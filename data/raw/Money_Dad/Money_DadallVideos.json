            "description": "* I am not a financial advisor *\n\n2020 has been a wild year, and what an adventure for me and my family. We have been so fortunate to make it through 2020 healthy and actually make some progress toward our ultimate financial goals. I don't normally reveal my stock portfolio, but in this video I reveal and review how my investments and savings performed in 2020, and set financial goals for myself for 2021. I review several different investment portfolios that I am managing, and make specific goals for how much money I would like to see each grow to in 2021. A lot of this was made possible by paying off all of our debt, becoming debt free, and freeing up that cash flow to allow us to start building savings and investments. Are you setting goals for 2021?\n\nI am so thankful for everyone here that has watched my videos and subscribed to my channel. I hope you all have an amazing 2021! \n\nThanks, \n\nBrad / Money Dad\n\n2020 Investment Review and 2021 Financial Goals | Money Goals for 2021\n\n0:00 Intro\n\nSubscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qB_3XYgujbqYr9vOPPXcg \n\nInvesting Platform Referral Links:\nhttps://join.robinhood.com/bradlen118 Use this code to join Robinhood (stocks and crypto mobile app) and receive a free stock share when you sign up!\n\nhttps://refer.etrade.net/bradleyneveu Use this code to start investing with Etrade (stocks) and receive a cash credit!\n\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=13321008 Use this code to create a Binance account if you want to invest in bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. \n\nMy disclaimer:\nLegal Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser or accountant, and anything said in my videos are my personal opinions and sharing my insight on the stock market.

Biden is likely to win the presidential election, but the market is up because the senate is going to remain republican, which blocks Biden’s tax plan from going through. With a favorable tax plan currently in place for the market, we are picking up gains now post election after pricing in the Biden win and tax plan pre election. It's 11/5/2020 and we've been watching this election and stock market closely for 2 days now. Will we have a result today?!\n\nBy the way, let me know if you like these \"shorts\" style quick updates in the comments below.\n\n#shorts #stocks #election\n\nBrad / Money Dad",

In this video I break down how to get started investing in stocks and the stock market. Before opening a taxable investment account, I recommend maxing out a 401K (if your employer offers it) and/or Roth IRA first. Once you are to the point where you are maxed out on annual contributions to those accounts, then starting a taxable investment account makes more financial sense. Choose a brokerage, fund the account, then choose which investment you want to put your money into. I break down brokerages and the different kinds of stock investments to choose from if you are looking for performance similar to the stock market.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:30 Before\n1:58 Choose Broker\n3:30 Choose Investment\n5:42 Summary\n6:30 Outro\n\nLet me know what you think and if you enjoyed this content, please like, subscribe, and comment below!\n\nThanks, \n\nBrad / Money Dad\n\nSubscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qB_3XYgujbqYr9vOPPXcg \n\nhttps://join.robinhood.com/bradlen118 Use this code to join Robinhood (stocks and crypto mobile app) and receive a free stock share when you sign up!\n\nhttps://refer.etrade.net/bradleyneveu Use this code to start investing with Etrade (stocks) and receive a cash credit!\n\nMy tools:\nhttps://www.canva.com/join/kpr-swr-fwm for thumbnails (free)\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?share_your_love=ImportantImports for charts (free) \nhttps://www.Movavi.com to edit\nhttps://www.OBSproject.com to record (free) \nhttps://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/ Blue Yeti microphone\niPhone 7 camera\nAdding a Canon EOS Rebel T3i soon\nAn old Acer laptop \n\nMy disclaimer:\nLegal Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser or accountant, and anything said in my videos are my personal opinions and sharing my insight on the stock market.

Dave Ramsey is well known through his radio and TV shows, books, and speaking events. His baby steps include saving for an emergency fund, the debt snowball method, investing for retirement, and eventually becoming free of any major requirements on your money so you are able to do what you want, not what you have to. I explain Dave Ramsey's baby steps program, and also provide my opinion on some of the steps that can be approached in different ways that I feel may be better in some situations, but ultimately reach the same end goal of getting out of debt fast and reaching financial peace. \n\n0:00 Intro\n01:13 Baby Step 1\n02:15 Baby Step 2\n05:13 Baby Step 3\n05:56 Baby Step 4\n06:53 Baby Step 5\n09:57 Baby Step 6\n10:41 Baby Step 7\n12:25 Dave Ramsey's Website\n13:08 Bloopers\n\nhttps://www.daveramsey.com/\nhttps://www.daveramsey.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps\n\nLet me know what you think and if you enjoyed this content, please like, subscribe, and comment below!\n\nThanks, \n\nBrad / Money Dad\n\nSubscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qB_3XYgujbqYr9vOPPXcg \n\nMy tools:\nhttps://www.canva.com/join/kpr-swr-fwm for thumbnails (free)\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?share_your_love=ImportantImports for charts (free) \nhttps://www.Movavi.com to edit\nhttps://www.OBSproject.com to record (free) \nhttps://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/ Blue Yeti microphone\niPhone 7 camera\nAdding a Canon EOS Rebel T3i soon\nAn old Acer laptop \n\nMy disclaimer:\nLegal Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser or accountant, and anything said in my videos are my personal opinions and sharing my insight on the stock market.
