This shows each stock's performance over the time period that you choose overlayed on each other, giving a nice visual comparison of which stock has done better or worse than the others. In the video I use multiple airlines, Apple, and Amazon for examples, but this can be done with any stock chart. This can also be used for any asset that can be found in TradingView, like cryptocurrency and commodities. \n\nLet me know what you think and if you enjoyed this content, please like, subscribe, and comment below!\n\nThanks, \n\nBrad / Money Dad\n\nHow to Compare Stocks | Overlaying Stocks in TradingView\n\n\nMade some money in the market and want to fuel my coffee addiction?

I made the prediction back on December 11th in the video linked above. I discuss the FCEL stock chart pattern analysis that went into that prediction, the probability of chart pattern analysis, and then analyze FCEL's technical indicators for the way forward. Is FCEL still a good stock to buy now, even after it has run up so much lately?

We have been so fortunate to make it through 2020 healthy and actually make some progress toward our ultimate financial goals. I don't normally reveal my stock portfolio, but in this video I reveal and review how my investments and savings performed in 2020, and set financial goals for myself for 2021. I review several different investment portfolios that I am managing, and make specific goals for how much money I would like to see each grow to in 2021. A lot of this was made possible by paying off all of our debt, becoming debt free, and freeing up that cash flow to allow us to start building savings and investments. Are you setting goals for 2021?\n\nI am so thankful for everyone here that has watched my videos and subscribed to my channel.

Some PS5s are going for thousands of dollars second hand. What if you invested that money in stocks like Tesla, Apple, or Amazon instead? In this video I show the opportunity cost of buy a Playstation 5, aka wow much money you would have if you had invested that money instead of buying the PS5. In some cases, you could have made far more than $1,000,000. \n\nLet me know what you think and if you enjoyed this content, please like, subscribe, and comment below!\n\nThanks, \n\nBrad \n\nSubscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qB_3XYgujbqYr9vOPPXcg \n\nInvesting Platform Referral Links:\nhttps://join.robinhood.com/bradlen118 Use this code to join Robinhood (stocks and crypto mobile app) and receive a free stock share when you sign up!\n\nhttps://refer.etrade.net/bradleyneveu Use this code to start investing with Etrade (stocks) and receive a cash credit!\n\nhttps://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=13321008 Use this code to create a Binance account if you want to invest in bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. \n\nMy tools:\nhttps://www.canva.com/join/kpr-swr-fwm for thumbnails (free)\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?share_your_love=ImportantImports for charts (free) \nhttps://www.Movavi.com to edit\nhttps://www.OBSproject.com to record (free) \nhttps://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/ Blue Yeti microphone\niPhone 7 camera\nAdding a Canon EOS Rebel T3i soon\nAn old Acer laptop \n\nMy disclaimer:\nLegal Disclaimer: I am not a financial adviser or accountant, and anything said in my videos are my personal opinions and sharing my insight on the stock market.

Once you are to the point where you are maxed out on annual contributions to those accounts, then starting a taxable investment account makes more financial sense.
