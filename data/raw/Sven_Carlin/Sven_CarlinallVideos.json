            "description": "IBM stock analysis - Is IBM stock a buy after a decade of terrible performance? Not an easy answer but here we go:\n\n0:00 IBM stock price\n0:32 Summary points\n4:39 IBM business overview\n7:10 dividend buybacks\n10:16 IBM stock valuation\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) stock analysis content:\n- IBM stock key points summary\n- IBM stock price overview (Lower than Buffett’s 2011 buying level and 2017 selling level)\n- IBM business analysis (Hybrid cloud focus and NewCo spin-off)\n- IBM fundamentals (IBM dividend & buybacks)\n- IBM valuation and risk and reward investment conclusion (excel model included)\nIBM stock key points and issues summary\nThe main issues the market sees for IBM are the following (I’ve read approximately 30 analysts reports and listened to the latest conference calls):\n- Lagging industry peers in growth\n- Leverage growth on declining revenue and income\n- Continuous stagnation and weak performance\n- Red Hat questionable merger rationale\n- Beating analysts’ estimates in only 2 of the last 8 quarters\n- Revenue estimates down from $80 billion to $76 billion for 2021\n- 2022 EPS estimates cut from $15 to $13 due to COVID\n- Reducing employee count – thus not trying to grow and leading to high skill loss (example: Lisa Su – left in 2007, currently CEO of AMD that has a market cap close to IBM’s now)\n- Former CEO Rometty’s compensation went from $16 million in 2012 to $158 million in 2019 while the market capitalization went down significantly. To me personally, a picture like the following tells me the CEO is focused on herself and on the ivory tower she lived in, but that is just a subjective perspective and hopefully things change now with the new CEO\n- Buffett bought $10.7 billion in 2011, took a look and sold\n- IBM spent $200 billion on buybacks over since 1994 – almost twice the current market capitalization\n- IBM will split in 2021, thus it will spend two years focusing on how to split instead of focusing on how to grow\n- No buybacks till debt ratios improve – around 2022 at first\n- M&A strategy is unclear, also unclear where will the discussed growth come from\n- Quantum computing is too early to create profits in this decade\n- Cloud will be a commodity in the future, with thin margins given the already strong competitive environment (think: Amazon, Microsoft and Google).\n\nAn interesting view from Jim Chanos, I'll make a video to dig into his numbers better because IBM is his highest conviction short pic.\nhttps://youtu.be/aDrtvFfw-pw?t=1314\n\nWhat is this channel all about?

I don't think AMZN will grow at a slower pace than 15% over the next 5 to 7 years which should give a good return to investors in the worst case scenario. With growth of 15% AMZN will soon reach EBAY's value metrics.\nAll in all, one one hand we have growth with AMZN and on the other asset value and good free cash flows with EBAY. Both good businesses that have rewarded shareholders well over the past decade (EBay - think PayPal).\nThe key question to answer is which is best for you and at what stock price could AMZN or EBAY be margin of safety additions to your portfolio.\nVisa stock analysis and delta of the delta tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLFaekkm6F8\n\nWhat is this channel all about?

By focusing on minimizing the downside, what is left is only upside.\n8) Intrinsic value is key – it is calculated by looking at what is the present value to you personally, of all the future cash flows a business will likely deliver from today to judgement day.\n9) The lower the stock price is, below your intrinsic value calculation alongside a margin of safety with conservative calculations, the lower is the risk of investing. Consequently, as the stock price increases, the risk becomes higher.\n10) Bottom line, it is all about comparing and finding the lowest risk, highest return opportunities for your portfolio that will lead you towards your financial goals with the highest possible level of certainty.\n\n#valueinvesting #warrenbuffett #investing",

            "description": "What will cause the next stock market crash? Well, the answer is you!\nThe Inelastic Market Hypothesis explains the volatility in the stock market, also explains why stock market crashes are usually so sharp and fast. Plus, you might not believe it, but YOU are the reason behind stock market crashes as households, with their flows, drive the market.\n\nThe Inelastic Market Hypothesis, developed by professor Gabaix and Kooijen, from Harvard and Booth respectively, shows how 30% of stock market fluctuations can be explained by flows. This confirms the thesis that you and me, drive the markets and also explains the risks as our selling drives crashes. \nThanks to the market's in-elasticity, $1 dollar invested, increases the value of the market by $5 because there simply isn't enough supply to make markets efficient. The opposite also holds. \nInelastic Market Hypothesis content\n\n0:00 Inelastic Market Hypothesis\n3:56 Inelastic Market Nature\n6:10 You Make Stocks Crash\n9:10 Importance\n11:28 Investing Conclusion\n14:27 Market Can Double\n\nThe four pillars of the Inelastic Market Hypothesis are that:\n- institutional funds have rigid constrains and can't really do much\n- hedge funds own only 5% of the market, thus can't balance the remaining 95%\n- risk isn't transferred among sectors\n- markets are less efficient on the macro level than on the micro\n\nThe Inelastic Market Hypothesis is important as it explains market volatility, why markets crash but also as it helps understand the impact of buybacks, government intervention and other factors impacting the stock market. As for investing, imagine what $1 invested does with low volume stocks or shallow markets.\nvideos mentioned: Very Good Food Stock Analysis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkl39ppvTGg\n\nSSRN article on the Inelastic Market Hypothesis - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3686935 \n\nMy passion is to look for low risk high reward investment opportunities with a long-term business owning like focus.

Long-term contracts are in place where the company's business model is like a toll business which leads to future guaranteed cash flows. However, there is also the guaranteed debt that is more certain than the cash flows that hangs above Cheniere Energy like a big dark cloud.\nLNG stock should become a cash flow positive one by next year, should consequently lower its debt and then even pay dividends mid 2020s. \nI have made a valuation that will help you see what is the expected return and the risk when it comes to investing into LNG stock. Cheniere will reach positive cash flows from next year onward that should improve its debt metrics, credit rating and stock price.\n\nThis analysis is just an initial introduction in a full sector, stock by stock analysis of LNG and natural gas investment opportunities like I did for copper. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKRdDA1i2UA\n\nFor more insights and similar researches on a weekly basis, plus monthly sector analyses, check my stock market research platform.\nSTOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM (business research and risk reward analysis, stocks to buy from my covered stocks list, my portfolio):\n\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nAre you an investor that is just starting?

            "title": "Buffett On How To Make Buying Decisions Fast",
            "description": "How does Warren Buffett make his buying decisions?\n\nHow Warren Buffett Makes His Buying Decisions (7 Quick Steps)\n\nDuring the 2002 Berkshire shareholder conference one of the questions was about the process Buffett uses when he makes his quick decisions on investing in a business or stock.\nBuffett is known for making investment decisions and buying businesses while talking to owners or analyzing the business for less than 90 minutes. The specific company the question was referring to is Albecca, a company that sells picture frames which Berkshire acquired in 2001.\nI have systematized the answers, here is the video with Buffett answering himself and you have the bullet points below.\n\n1:48 Understand the business\n4:02 Know the price\n5:12 Good businesses are simple\n5:45 Can a competitor destroy the moat?\n6:20 Wait for the no brainers\n7:13 Don’t trust projections\n10:00 Use horse sense\n\nMy passion is to look for low risk high reward investment opportunities with a long-term business owning like focus. I apply my accounting skills and investing experience in order to find the best businesses to own that offer the possibility to lead me towards my financial goals. \nIf you are a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses and investing ideas, here is my STOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM (business research and risk reward analysis, stocks to buy from my covered stocks list, my portfolio):\n\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nAre you an investor that is just starting? Sign up for the FREE Stock Market Investing Course - a comprehensive guide to investing discussing all that matters: https://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-investing\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nCheck my website to hear more about me, read my analyses and about OUR charity. (YouTube ad money is donated)\nwww.svencarlin.com\n\nListen to Modern Value Investing Podcast:\nhttps://svencarlin.com/podcasts/\n\n1) Don’t spend too much time on irrelevant things\nOne of Buffett’s advantages is that he knows immediately what to focus on when it comes to analyzing a stock or business: the moat, the cash flows, needed working capital and the price he has to pay. \n\n2) Know the price you are willing to pay\nWhat is the right price to pay for something?\nWell, that depends on you, if you are aiming at a 10% return from an investment, then if the company makes $10 per year, you should be happy paying anything like $100 or less. Buffett now (2020), expects to make 8 to 10% on his investments as his size limits his investment options, so that is the price he is willing to pay for an acquisition. Given the low interest rates and high available liquidity, other investment funds are willing to pay more than Buffett for good businesses and that is why we haven’t seen a major acquisition from Berkshire for a while. Consequently, Buffett is waiting with cash for the no brainer investment, we’ll discuss that in a bit.\n \n3) Understand the business, the industry and how it works\nThis one might be easy for Buffett, but not for others. When it comes to understanding a business, Buffett thinks of moat or competitive advantages. If a company has a strong moat, is likely to be there still in business 10 or 20 years from now, hopefully even growing, is profitable, doesn’t need too much capital, doesn’t need to much debt or to take any crazy risks, then it is something for Buffett. \nA business Buffett finds impossible to understand is the automotive industry as he says you can analyze it for ages and not know who will be the leader in 10 years. We are seeing now Tesla in the lead, but we don’t know if there will be some other company taking the throne of most valuable automotive company 10 years from now. It all depends on customer preferences which is a very difficult thing, practically impossible, to understand. Additionally, the competition is constant and huge. For example, the number of electric vehicle models by 2022 is expected to be already at 500.\n\n4) Can somebody eat up your moat, at what cost?\nNot discussed in the video, but when buying Coca Cola, Buffett made an analysis how a company had to spend $50 billion to get to the same brand recognition as Coca Cola had in the 1980s while the market capitalization was $10 billion. That was a big moat for Buffett, a moat that was hard to destroy, alongside low capital needs and high margins. Fast forward 30 years, and Coca Cola is still one of the most recognized brands in the world. \n\n5) Wait for no brainers\nPatience is key for  Munger  and when you wait for no brainer investment, everything easy. I would say no brainers come more often than you might expect even if it might seem like there aren’t any available at the moment. Just be patient and something will hit your sweet spot.\n \n6) Don’t buy what is being sold to you \n  \n7) Use horse sense\n\n\n#warrenbuffett #berkshire #buffett",

            "description": "Last week I made a video how one should not fear stock market crashes, but investment tragedies and I explained the stock market environment that might lead to low long-term returns, from COVID and stimulus to low interest rates and demographics.\nI today's video I go more in depth on the technical part of why a stock market crash is a blessing and what can one do to avoid an investing tragedy. Short term success stories are great, but the average investor achieved a return of only 2.1% over the last 20 years. That is an investment tragedy to be avoided because it is unlikely you will reach your financial goals with 2.1% per year. The low returns are not caused by crashes, the low returns are caused by investors not having a clear long-term investing strategy.\n\n0:00 Stock Market Crash A Blessing\n3:08 Stocks Are Expensive\n6:40 Low Dividend Yields\n10:08 Stocks Are Risky\n14:31 4 Strategies to Avoid Tragedies\n\nHere is the previous video discussing the current stock market environment:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBVi7J04ulA&feature=youtu.be\n\nMy passion is to look for low risk high reward investment opportunities with a long-term business owning like focus.

I just sold a stock that made 20% of my portfolio and it got me thinking that I could make an investing class about the best ways, the best strategies to use to approach selling a portfolio position. The 7 strategies to consider when selling a stock are:\n\n0:00 Selling a stock\n3:38 Something changed\n5:52 Risk and reward\n9:28 Portfolio balance\n12:13 Something better\n14:50 Stop loss\n16:48 Goal reached\n18:01 Never sell\n\nIt is always hard to sell a stock, but at some point you have to do it for one or other reason. Selling is difficult but it locks in your gains, eliminates the risks, allow you to invest in something else or simply allow you to reach your other than financial goals. \nAt the end, investing is strictly personal and I hope these 7 strategies help you when it comes to making the hard decision to sell something, hopefully with a big gain and not a big loss. \nThe main question in these days might be when to sell a stock for profit as we are at the top of an incredible bull market.\nKeep in mind each business, each stock and each individual investors is unique, therefore also each decision on when to sell a stock will be different. Hopefully these 7 strategies will help you in knowing when to sell and when not to sell a stock.\n\nMy passion is to look for low risk high reward investment opportunities with a long-term business owning like focus.

            "description": "RDS stock looks like a clear stock to buy. The negative trend has stopped, the selling might be done and over the coming few years things might improve for upside. However, you must be ready for volatility because what goes on in reality will differ from what Shell's management has in mind. This video goes through the key topics one should think about before investing in RDS stock.\n\n0:00 RDS stock price\n3:26 Shell business\n10:36 RDS stock fundamentals\n12:44 RDS dividend\n13:23 RDS stock valuation\n15:40 RDS investing strategy\n\nRDS stock performance will depend on the long-term oil price, but that will certainly be volatile, so you can take advantage of that by being faster than Wall Street, or not even Wall Street but Dutch and other pension funds. \nRDS dividend was one of the main reasons people invested it but I think that is over, the main investment gains are to be found in timely trades on the volatility of the stock depending on oil prices.\n\nI am not going to buy RDS stock because I prefer investments that have a positive structural, long-term tailwind like copper or natural gas to remain on the topic.

Where will oil price go is anybody's guess, but oil fundamentals are something we can think about and put that into a risk and reward perspective. \nMost western producers expect oil to be at $60 long-term, Russians see it at $40 and Saudi Arabia will simply set the price is prefers long-term. In order to invest in that, you need to know the level of risk you want to accept and understand the risk and reward of each possibility.\nOil stocks that have businesses with high production costs will be hit hard if oil is at $40 and jump high if oil goes to $60.

            "description": "The most common comment on my recent Berkshire Hathaway stock analysis was about Buffett being 90 and dying. I prefer to say that he will retire and that is what I'll discuss in this Berkshire Hathaway video. Buffett and Munger have created a good vehicle that will keep doing what it has been doing for decades now. Berkshire might not grow as fast because of its size, but will likely do very good with a return between 6% and 8% and it is probably the one that will survive and stay around forever. This is Berkshire and it is actually opposite to Wall Street. \nWhen it comes to investing in BRK, you have to see how this investing mindset Berkshire and Warren Buffett have fits your investment requirements. \nBerkshire offers a return between 6% and 10% depending on what happens in the world and there is not much to add to that. They might surprise with a great acquisition but then the economy should be in a bad situation. \nBerkshire Hathaway stock relative valuation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfRR_kk9Ask\n\nMy passion is to look for low risk high reward investment opportunities with a long-term business owning like focus. I apply my accounting skills and investing experience in order to find the best businesses to own that offer the possibility to lead me towards my financial goals. \nIf you are a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses and investing ideas, here is my STOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM (business research and risk reward analysis, stocks to buy from my covered stocks list, my portfolio):\n\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nAre you an investor that is just starting?

I believe how Buffett is investing, which is the opposite than corporate America, is a much better way to invest because it is focused long-term. There is no crazy leverage, Berkshire doesn't do crazy buybacks and there is the cash pile ready to take action when all others fail.\nThe funny thing is that Berkshire Hathaway is trading at a 40% discount to the market while being a better fundamental investment from all perspectives.

            "description": "Will there be a stock market crash ahead or will the FED (central banks globally) and the governments save the situation with their stimulus packages, low rates and asset purchases?\nWell, it doesn't really matter because what matters is that you focus on fundamentals that increase your wealth over time and the key to watch is the risk and reward of the assets you own in your portfolio in relation to what is going on.\nHowever, to know the risk and reward you have to know what impact have the things that are going on - the news. The key factors are:\n-  the FED's policy where interest rates are kept at zero, this makes financial assets very attractive and stimulates the economy. They will also allow for inflation which is key for investments.\n- fiscal stimulus - huge budget deficits give money directly to people and stimulate spending and investing\n- global economy - the news is that things are better than expected and global economic growth will decline only 4.5% compared to the 6% expected in June 2020.\n\nAs for investing, in the current market situation, a crash is unlikely but you never know. The key is to balance well your risks and we show a few examples.\n\n0:00 Stock market crash news\n0:49 Stock market overview\n4:24 Economy news\n8:14 Central banks\n9:45 Interest rates \n14:34 Stock market investing\n19:01 Random long-term trends\n\nREAL ESTATE is LOW RISK HIGH REWARD if you do it properly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBOR-q_8LGU&feature=youtu.be\n\nBarrick Gold stock analysis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZlPKehzCJ0&feature=youtu.be\n\nAAPL stock analysis: good buy expensive - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWBdcAfeg9k&feature=youtu.be\n\nIntel stock analysis: https://svencarlin.com/intel-stock-analysis/\n\nAustralia airport - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhPz6M46t88&feature=youtu.be\n\nI look for low risk high reward investment opportunities with a long-term focus.

            "description": "Barrick Gold stock is one of the biggest gold miners out there and a very interesting stock to think about when considering investing in gold or gold mining stocks. I have been discussing gold since the beginning of my YouTube channel in 2017 and it is always good to check whether there is an opportunity. Before investing in gold or a gold mining stock, it is important to check where the gold price is from a risk and reward perspective, where are the miner's margins in relation to gold and how could changes in the market affect gold prices and gold stock prices. This approach gives you the answer when considering how can gold and gold stocks fit your portfolio.\n\n0:00 Gold stocks\n3:36 Gold mining stock prices\n6:24 Investing in gold miners\n7:35 Barrick gold\n7:59 Life of mine\n10:01 Carlin mine\n12:07 Barrick dividend\n12:31 Stock valuation\n14:36 Gold price\n16:45 Portfolio fit\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

However, the business looks stable and they are not repeating the mistakes of 2011 when they went deep into growth resulting in an 85% stock price decline by 2015.\nAt the end it is about how gold fits your portfolio.\n\n#gold #goldstocks #barrick",

            "title": "Apple Stock Analysis Explains The Market Crash (up 314% in 5 years)",
            "description": "Apple stock, given its $2 trillion valuation, is the perfect stock to discuss also the market and the weekly crash. The market is irrational and 20% crashes in a week should not be excluded in the future because when valuations are high, return expectations are based on swing moves and not on fundamentals, sell-offs will come often but fear of missing out will also push stocks higher, as long as interest rates are low.\nAs for Apple stock, it is incredible how the market changed its sentiment in just 4 years. In 2016 AAPL was a pure value investment while now it is a bet on what will happen with markets, interest rates or valuations.\nI try to explain what are the key risks when it comes to investing in today's market and what one should focus on when looking at investing opportunities.\nAAPL is the perfect example to do this so this video is a mix of a market and the stock analysis. Key factors that impact the market today are valuations, dividends, even more buybacks, stock splits etc. All discussed with interesting examples.\nApple stock analysis and market explanation video content:\n\n00:00 Apple stock price\n04:32 Market valuation\n05:31 Apple is cheap\n07:02 Market crash - volatility\n07:49 Apple's business\n11:14 Fundamentals\n15:03 Dividend\n15:22 Apple's buybacks\n19:07 S&P 500 buybacks\n20:08 Stock splits\n21:55 Returns ahead\n23:23 Stock Price Forecast\n24:48 Investment conclusion\n\nThe fundamental stock today: Intel! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7gyJS9cryA\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

            "description": "Facebook stock is up more than 100% over the last year but the growth rate actually slowed down over the past year. A growth rate at 10% is much different than a 15% or 20% growth rate especially when the valuation is not 20 anymore by 40. \nSo, now, Facebook stock is not a value investment anymore but a speculative investment based on hopes of business growth, Facebook shop and all other things that were there too when the stock was at $122 just a while ago.\nTherefore, I sold by Facebook shares as I am not an investor that just hopes on valuation expansion based on some growth. I will keep following FB stock and watching for investing opportunities. If the stock doubles next, well so be it. \nI this video I give an overview of Facebook's earnings, the growth situation and the stock valuation.\n\n00:00 Facebook stock\n01:11 Stock price action\n02:12 FB Q2 earnings\n05:10 Real Estate\n06:41 Facebook stock valuation\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

            "description": "The Fed will used all the tools at its disposal to keep the market up, even inflation at 5% for a few years is possible. They believe this will help to reach full employment and economic growth.\nFor now, it is helping only financial assets as we see stocks just go up no matter the worst economic situation since the Great Depression.\nHowever, the FED can help until it can't, until we lose confidence in currencies. One day we will and then even this monetary policy 3 too will be exhausted and it will all boil down to productivity and as Ray Dalio says, a new cycle will start.\nFor us investors, it means that we have to focus on the certainties and perhaps be a bit more aggressive when we find value because the dollar, euro and all other currencies will surely lose value. Real assets, earnings and dividends with pricing power are the answer.\nOn inflation, the New York Times was 2 cents when Roosevelt forbid the ownership of gold, 15 cents when Nixon closed the final link with gold and now we are at above $2, thus a 100 times more. That is inflation and you can expect it to happen faster in the future.\n\n00:00 The FED making history\n04:03 INFLATION, PARADIGM SHIFT\n05:25 FED is usually WRONG\n08:12 INFLATION TARGET\n11:09 Can it go WRONG?\n12:41 The DOLLAR COLLAPSE\n14:09 Dollar replacement\n15:11 Economic recession\n16:09 Japan comparison\n17:28 Preventing Stocks From CRASHING\n19:21Cheap money\n20:36 OUTLOOK\n21:52 BEST INVESTMENT\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

            "description": "An Intel Stock Analysis has been what most of you requested so, because the stock is down but has good fundamentals and offers a very positive outlook, I went into a deep analysis.\nI also bought Intel stock for my portfolios because the risk and reward is on the positive investing side despite the murky short term outlook that many analysts have.\nWhen it comes to buying Intel stock, one has to differentiate between the negative news or noise that has pushed Intel's stock price below $50 and the fundamentals that still look good with high cash flows, strong buybacks and a growing dividend.\nIntel will definitely lose market share as the environment it operates is more and more competitive, but what is a key investment factor, the semiconductor sector is a growth one, and Intel can keep growing no matter the competition. AMD, NVDA, QCOM and others will do their thing for sure and eat into INtel's moat, but it is most likely Intel will keep growing.\nIn a conservative growth scenario of just 3% per year, and investment into Intel now would likely lead to great long term returns and that is why Intel is a stock to buy now.\nThere are also risks, Intel could end up like IBM, but it is more likely it will end up like Apple stock. Intel now reminds me of Apple in 2016 because the fundamentals were there but the analysts were all worries about the lack of innovation with the new iPhone and consequently lower revenue growth and no profit growth. They were completely right, but the stock went from $100 to the current $500.

Your best friend is Google and look for confirmations on what is the management selling.\nSo, when it comes to biotech stock prices, it all depends on whether the product will ever get traction. However, a market cap of 136 million EUR on 5 million of sea weed sales is remarkable!\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

            "description": "Adidas stock (symbol: ADDYY) did much better than Nike stock (NKE) over the last 5 years because the company copied what Nike did. However, Nike's valuation is still much higher and the debt is piling up. Therefore, Adidas is the better stock to invest in, but you never know given it is also a question about investing in European stocks vs. American stocks.\nI made a video on Nike stock in June: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33FVH4lkpZU\n\nMy conclusion for Nike’s stock was overvaluation from a fundamental perspective and risky because:\n- a growth slowdown is happening and what makes things worse,\n- the management is attempting to conceal the slowdown with financial engineering.\n- Nike has an extreme PE ratio which makes the stock even riskier.\nIn this video I’ll discuss Adidas stock as an investment opportunity and compare it to Nike stock and explain why long-term investors will continue to be better off investing in Adidas stock for the long-term.\nThis analysis will comprehend the following:\n- Adidas stock vs Nike Stock price movement\n- General business environment for both Nike and Adidas based on Q2 2020 results\n- Strategic comparison and risks\n- Adidas and Nike Stock fundamental comparison\nThrough the analysis I’ll also touch on the core investing concepts one has to think about in this environment where Adidas and Nike come as amazing examples:\n- The risks of growth investing – Both Nike and Adidas stock prices have long-term growth priced in\n- Do fundamentals matter at all in this market?\n- Financial engineering – is it ok to take debt to push the stock higher? Nike’s debt bonanza.\nSo, all in all, it is not so much about the better investment, but about investing in general when it comes to Nike and Adidas.\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

The repercussions of the situation will be felt for a long time and therefore we have to carefully watch our investments and options from a value and risk perspective in the environment.\n\n00:00 Stock market news\n01:48 All weather investing\n02:40 Market today\n04:23 Higher inflation\n06:58 Lower inflation\n08:04 Deflation\n09:18 Economy is bad\n09:46 Stimulus\n10:44 Investment outlook\n13:45 Investment solution\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

            "description": "Many say Warren Buffett lost his touch because Berkshire has been underperforming the S&P 500 index. The arguments are that Buffett didn't take advantage of the 2020 stock market crash, how his $137 billion are idle, that Occidental, Heinz and Airlines have been a huge mistake and how Buffett should be investing in the new stocks out there.\nI am arguing that there is a difference between investing that works always and speculation that works just sometimes. Investing will make you richer and richer over the long-term while speculation will make you rich until thing turn south. Berkshire outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 20 years alongside extremely low risk. I would say, over the next 20 years, the story will be similar.\nThe main message is the differentiation between long-term sustainable investing and speculation.

I love owning parts, even small parts of great businesses, watch the businesses grow and alongside their growth, watch my dividends and wealth grow. I have been investing for almost 20 years now and it has been extremely rewarding for me. \nQ:  WHAT IS YOUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY?\nWhen it comes to markets there are many uncertainties and a few certainties. I prefer to focus on certainties and those are the following for me:\n- Investment returns will be perfectly correlated with the performance of the underlying business over the long term. INVESTMENT CONCLUSION: Invest in businesses that can deliver good business returns, growth and consequently great rewards to shareholders.\n- Avoid risk – a factor you can never work enough on! If you focus on avoiding risk, the only thing left is upside. One might think that it is impossible to avoid risk when investing, but that depends on how you define risk. For me, risk is the possibility of permanent capital loss, not volatility. So, INVESTMENT CONCLUSION: if you invest with a MARGIN OF SAFETY (if the worst case scenario happens, that is good too), a MODERN VALUE INVESTING ATTITUDE focused on likely future cash flows, do a lot of RESEARCH and wait for the right OPPORTUNITIES, you will reach good investment returns.\n- I am also convinced markets are completely irrational and actually have a bipolar disorder. Sometimes markets are extremely exuberant while at other times totally pessimistic. My idea is that the world is not going to end tomorrow but also not become a fairy tale tomorrow. INVESTMENT CONCLUSION: take advantage of the market’s inherent VOLATILITY (what others call risk).\nQ: WHAT MAKES A GOOD INVESTMENT?\nFuture cash flows! Investing is all about how much cash you have to renounce now in comparison to how much cash you are going to get in the future. It is that simple. \n\nQ: HOW DO YOU INVEST? WHAT IS YOUR GOAL?\nI invest with the goal of increasing my financial wellbeing. The wellbeing can come in the form of dividends or capital gains. Over the past 20 years, I have been blessed with wonderful gains that have improved the quality of my life by quantum leaps. So, I continue to invest, compound and hopefully increase my wealth and wellbeing. I hope that by sharing what I do, others can benefit too.\nI invest through my public portfolios on my research platform. I actually have one portfolio that is divided in 3 parts based strategy, and my goal is to have more than a million in each of those portfolio parts.\nI started my LUMP SUM PORTFOLIO in 2019 with 100,000 and the goal is to turn it into 1,000,000 one day. (if I make 12% per year over 20 years I am there – but hopefully sooner)\nI started my MODEL PORTOFLIO with 10,000 in May 2018 and I add 1,000 to it each month. Again, if I make 12% per year, I’ll be at a million in 20 years.\nWith my PRIVATE PORTFOLIO, I’ll add funds that I have available for investing, and also hopefully grow that to 1 million and more over time.\nWith 3 million in investments, one day, the dividends should be enough to sustain my life style and I will be able to do whatever I want. This will likely be investment research and investment education as I am really passionate about it, but probably Buffett style.\nQ: HOW DOES YOUR PORTFOLIO LOOK LIKE?\n\nQ: HOW MANY POSITIONS DO YOU EXPECT TO HOLD IN YOUR PORTFOLIOS?\n\nQ: WHAT IS YOUR TARGETED PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION?\n\nQ: WHAT IS YOUR ANTICIPATED HOLDING PERIOD AND SELLING CRITERIA?\n\nQ: WHAT ARE YOU CURRENTLY WORKING ON?\n\n#stocks #stockmarket #investing",

However, it isn't that easy and you need to know which are the factors to watch. It is not just about the usually high REIT dividends - there is more to watch - from FFO, revaluations, tenant quality and leverage.\nWe discuss CA Immo Stock which is a real estate stock owning commercial properties in Europe traded on the Austrian Stock Exchange. You can call it a European Reit. The dividend yield is 3.4% and the PE ratio just 6 because of the crazy real estate revaluations they constantly do.

            "description": "Nike Stock Analysis shows how Nike is definitely a great business - we share 6 key fundamental factors that show how Nike stock represents a great business, from a dividend growth stock to improving margins across low capital necessities. \nHowever, Nike's stock price is really expensive from a fundamental perspective given the PE ratio of 36, likely going higher after next earnings, and due to the growth rate that is not as high as it was in the past. \nOver the last years, NIKE's revenue growth was around 6%, much below the usual 9% over the past 15 years. Therefore I would dare to say Nike is not a good stock to buy now. But, given the free money environment, you will decide for yourself whether Nike is a stock to buy or sell based on the fundamentals analyzed.\n\n0:00 Nike Stock Analysis\n3:13 Nike Stock Fundamentals\n10:23 Nike Investment Thesis\n15:23 Nike Stock Price\n\nVisa growth stock analysis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLFaekkm6F8\n\nAre you a sophisticated investor looking for in depth, independent stock analyses for investing ideas?Here is my independent stock market analysis and research!

It rewarded some shareholders with 700 times their money since 1985.\n- Why Nike might not be a great investment in the coming decade as it was over the last decades due to a slowdown in growth and increase of financial engineering that usually leads to only short-term benefits.\n- We will finish with an investment thesis based on the discussed fundamentals and what is the key you have to watch if you are a Nike investor.\n\n#nikestock #stockanalysis #stocks",

However, you can only know something is a stock market bubble after there is a stock market crash because if it doesn't pop or crash, it never becomes a bubble. \nIn any case, we define what a stock market bubble is, what are the core concepts of a bubble, why a bubble bursts. We apply the Minsky credit cycle model to the current economic and stock market environment and also look into the fundamentals of the market because a bubble is a bubble only when the market is detached from fundamentals.

            "description": "In 2008 banks were too big to fail! In 2020, stocks might be too big too fail!\nWe discuss the financialization of the economy,, how household wealth is impacted by financial engineering and low interest rates force people to invest. This all leads to stocks being hot and discussed by many, cheap brokers like Robinhood add to the party. Usually, it would be a huge warning sign for the stock  market, but today it might be indicating that stocks are too big to fail.\nWith stocks being $28 trillion of american wealth, or 23%, it is hard to imagine the FED letting the market crash due to repercussions on consumption and spending. Plus, the stimulus might keep the not so rich happy and avoid populism. It all depends how the current financial engineering situation will be managed.\nHow the FED and politicians react will have huge repercussions on your investing, how the stimulus is used and how it impacts the economic situation. \n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "description": "Nutrien Dividend Stock Analysis -  A stock to watch!\nTHE KEYS WHEN IT COMES TO NUTRIEN:\n- Low cost potash producer with 6 million tonnes production ramp up option at extremely low cost and 50 years of production ahead - gives a margin of safety, also the high margins protect the dividend\n- Integrated with retail after the merger with Agrium contributing $650 million in synergies - the retail segment is not as volatile as the fertilizer segment which gives also more stability to the dividend\n- $2 billion cash flow at the bottom, or possible bottom, of the fertilizer cycle. Even if cash flows fall to just $1 billion, that is what they pay out for dividends, thus still some room left\n- Good distributions to shareholders and sound balance sheet - strong buybacks and dividends from free cash flows\n- Possible growth coming from potential higher fertilizer pricing but also from operations as the constantly invest for growth. This could be a long-term compounder and dividend growth stock. Don't expect the dividend to grow linearly because the business isn't such, but it can grow\n- Potash is an oligopoly with 9 global players playing the prisoners dilemma game with China and India on pricing and production rates\n- Global demand is likely to grow but production growth has also a lot of potential. However, expansion is not cheap\n- The market is expecting lower for longer potash prices that would put pressure on the company and perhaps lower dividends\n- The trend is for an increase in demand for potash over the long-term.\n- Stock is at multi decade lows.\n- To make it a great stock to buy, a low risk high reward one, the market cap needs to be around $12 billion! So, depending on your risk appetite, see whether it is a stock to buy or a stock to watch. \n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

If you are not ready for that, better don't invest in stocks! It is that simple!\n\nIt is not about whether there is going to be a crash next, it is about what are you going to do when a crash comes and are you ready if stocks don't crash. \nI have looked at research that shows how investors under perform the market by trying to time a stock market crash and about how difficult it is to time it. The key is that you see how does the possibility and magnitude of a crash fit your tolerance. Stocks can crash 70% anytime and stay down for decades - are you ready for that?\nWhen it comes to individual stocks, the situation gets uglier. 30% of individual stocks will crash and actually deliver negative returns. Only 4% of stocks will do really great and compound! Can you handle the pain of investing in stocks? \nIf you can't, I don't know, buy a house!\nStocks can crash and individual stocks even more written version: https://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/courses/494365/lectures/17085038\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

This is such a reminder of 1999 when all dot-com stocks were exploding and BRK was down because Buffett was old fashioned. What we are seeing now is a similar situation with Buffett's 'HUGE' AIRLINES MISTAKE haha.\nHowever, we take a look the investment vehicle Berkshire is and that explains the risk and reward of investing in BRK and why, in my opinion BRK stock will always outperform the S&P 500 index!\nWe take a look at book values, equity compounding, valuation and cash flow - which is what BRK stock is all about.\nVideo summary:\n\n1:56 - Investing risk and reward - getting rich slowly! Performance comparison with S&P 500 index.\n\n10:36 - Buffett's airlines mistake is not really a mistake, just plain investing.\n\n15:05 - Don't bet against America!\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "description": "Google stock 2020 analysis. We are going to use Peter Lynch's categorization of fast growing stocks to analyze Google (Alphabet stock) GOOG, GOOGL. Fast growing stocks have certain characteristics and expectations and we are showing how Google stock fits those expectations. This should give you an answer whether GOOG is a stock you should buy or not. \n\nMore about the method can be found in this video on Peter Lynch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw1S1V4ASQw&feature=emb_logo\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

Per Jenster and Peter Barklin at the Niche Masters fund.\nhttp://nichemastersfund.com\n\nGoogle stock is the top position of the Sequoia Fund, a legendary fund set up by Bill Ruane, a student of Benjamin Graham. \n\nGoogle stock from a Peter Lynch perspective\n\nWhen looking at Google stock, an investor that just read Peter Lynch’s book One Up On Wall Street would ask:\n1. What is the safety of the investment, main risks?\n2. What is the yield?\n3. What is the growth rate?\n4. What is the investing outcome I can expect over the long-term?\n\nWe are going to answer the above by looking at Google by categorizing the stock according to Peter Lynch’s stock categorization. Google would definitely be a fast grower given its yearly revenue growth of 19.5% over the last 5 years.\n\nFor each stock category, Peter Lynch has summarized his expectations and the following are for a fast growing company like Google is. Let's see how Google fits as an investment:\n\n- If growth slows down the market doesn’t like it\n\nProbably the biggest risk for Google, on a price to earnings ratio of 27, any change in the growth rate would impact the valuation too. NEGATIVE\n\n- If finances become an issue Chapter 11 (bankruptcy is probable)\n\nWith no long-term debt and $31 billion in free cash flows in 2019, this is not an issue for Google. POSITIVE\n\n- Look for good balance sheets making substantial profits\n\nGoogle ticks this one perfectly, the balance sheet is strong with just $4 billion in long-term debt, return on capital employed has constantly been around the mid teen level and the business has high gross margins of 55%. There are many growth stocks, but few have a great business powering the growth. POSITIVE\n\n- Figure out when they’ll stop growing and how much to pay for growth.?\n\nThis is why I am not investing in Google. If the growth rate continues to be 15% per year over the next 10 years, earnings will hit $172, with a valuation of 30, what the market currently applies for the growth rate, the stock price would be $5,188. That would give you a return of 15% per year in line with the growth. \n \nBut, what if the growth slows down to 10% after year 5? And then to 4% after year 10? \n \nGogle stock price in 2029 would be $1,661, for a return of 2.3% per year if Google's stock valuation is 12. \n\nThis leads us to the next question:\n\n- At some point they will stop growing and turn into something else – that is the only guarantee. Check how much more room for growth there is.\n\nWhat if in 5 years somebody offers the same what Google or Facebook are offering but without ads at all. First 10 years free and then with a monthly subscription price of $5. Perhaps they can even integrate your FB or Google account with theirs – it is your data after all. I have no idea what will happen, so it is a growth stock risk reward situation, if the growth stops the situation turns ugly. And, the growth can stop at any time given the nature of the tech environment. \n\n- 20 to 25 percent is the best growth – 50 percent is for hot industries and you know what that means (hot industries attract many competitors)\n\nGoogle is definitely not a hot industry anymore, a mature search engine with a moat.\n\n- Proven, profitable expansion in more than one city or country\n\nIt is already global.\n\n- PE ratio should be below the growth rate\n\nPE ratio is double the growth rate, thus a risky play even for Lynch who loved fast growers.\n\n- Check whether growth is expanding or slowing down.\n\nGrowth is slowing down.\n\n- Look for those that few institutions own and that few have heard of.\n\nIt is in the top of the S&P 500, too late for that! It is already a big tech stock!\n\n#googlestock #stocks #stockmarket",

            "description": "I've received so many questions about the next upcoming stock market crash - the inevitable stock market crash in 2020 due to bad economies, budged deficits and insolvency issues. \nHowever, when investing, we have to see what are the forces driving stock prices, what is the market pricing in and how to best invest ourselves in line with our investment goals.\nTo see whether there is a market crash ahead, we are going to look at current and potential future news, but also at the elephant in the room, the FED, ECB, BOJ, that will do whatever it takes to keep the economy going forward, manage unemployment and keep prices stable. The bond market is $100 trillion, the stock market is also $100 trillion - the FED is putting $10 trillion in, a few will be added by the ECB etc. Plus, bond yields are turning negative - where will the $100 trillion fixed income go? \nWe end the stock market outlook discussing your potential investing strategy - after all it is your money and you have to see what is best for you to reach your financial goals. \n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "title": "My 4 Portfolios | Strategy And Stock Market Goals | Research",
            "description": "MY PORTFOLIOS – A BIT FOR EVERYONE’S INVESTING NEEDS\nI have things separated into two portfolio segments. One segment is the LUMP SUM, MODEL AND PERSONAL PORTFOLIO SEGMENT where the bulk of my money is and comprehend my top 10 investment ideas.\n\nMy target is to develop all the 3 portfolios towards 1 MILLION over time! I need an approximate return of 12% per year over 20 years to do that with the LUMP SUM AND MODEL PORTFOLIOS.\n\nThe other is the PETER LYNCH STYLE PORTFOLIO where I target having 50 positions because I see that only when I own something, I know it really well and that reflects also on the whole sector. Thus, over 2020 I’ll develop a portfolio of 30 to 50 positions where I’ll be forced to really know the businesses as I’ll own them. The target is always to make it a profitable venture even if it will not include my top ten investment ideas that are included in the other portfolios.\n\nMODEL PORTFOLIO\n\nThis is a portfolio launched in May 2018 with 10k and where I add 1k per month. This is a situation many of you probably find yourselves where you have some available cash on a monthly basis. My goal is to buy the best investment I can find each month and compound the portfolio with double digit returns for 20 years.\n\n\nI make an investment every month and this portfolio is fully invested as the monthly additions are the risk managing tool. The amount of position is usually around 10.\n\nIs it too late to join and follow the model portfolio?\n\nMany always wonder, since the portfolio has been launched in 2018, whether it is too late to join?\n\nWell, I consider investing a long-term investment process. Each month I add my 1000 and buy something. So, it is never late to start. Investing is a long-term game. The key is to start, doesn't matter when.\n\nLUMP SUM PORTFOLIO\n\nThe lump sum portfolio was launched during 2019 where the goal is to develop a strong track record. The initial investment was 100k and there will be no additions to it. So, to manage risk I apply the following strategy:\n\n80% invested in normal economic situations / 20% in cash\n100% invested during crises – like the current 2020 situation is\n125% invested when there are real bargains out there by leveraging the portfolio (currently only one portfolio transaction has been made using leverage using 16% of the allowed leverage). Here I only make a purchase if the likely return is above 20% per year with low risk.\nThe target is equal to the Model portfolio – to reach ONE MILLION in 20 years or perhaps even sooner.\n\n\nIs it too late to join and follow the lump sum portfolio?\n\nGiven the current situation, many of the positions are close or below my initial investment prices even if the portfolio is up. Therefore, given that we are investing in businesses for the long-term, rebalancing the portfolio depending on the risk and reward and always looking for better ideas, it is never too late to join and follow. Many admire Berkshire's portfolio but often forget it was build over the last 54 years. That is my plan too, buy great businesses when the opportunity comes, over a few decades, we will have a great portfolio.\n\nEven if you just get one really good idea per year from what I do, this research platform will be a great investment. After all, as would Munger say: “you only need a few good investments in your life”.\n\nPERSONAL PORTFOLIO\n\nTo show full transparency with any kind of financial instruments owned, I also show my personal transactions that are not related to the above portfolio except for the fact that the holdings will be the same as we are always talking about my top 10 ideas. So, here I simply invest when I have some liquidity and I like the investment.\n\nPETER LYNCH STYLE, LARGE PORTFOLIO\n\nI have been developing my covered stocks list over the last two years but I have figured that in order to really know something, to be able to follow it and timely make decisions, I’d better own the stock. So, I have decided to create a portfolio where I will actually own the stocks I follow. This will likely be profitable as I’ll do my best to make it profitable, but it will also be extremely helpful in better describing the risk reward of the investment and the expected return in relation to the stock price.\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "description": "This channel has passed 70k subscribers, I thank you for that. I wished to share the fundamentals of this investing channel by sharing my 5 core stock market investing beliefs:\n- the markets are not efficient - the efficient market hypothesis doesn't really work in the long-term and is something we can take advantage of. \n- long-term attitude - everybody is so focused on the short term and not on the long-term but the long-term really matters. Of course you can't forecast what will earnings be in 5 years, but you can forecast what will be the competitive advantages, the growth, the fundamentals, the risk etc. A long-term perspective tells you what will likely be the better investment in 5 years, that is all you need.\n- value or growth? Why not both? Growth is an essential part of value!\n- Research, research and research - the more stones you turn, the more ideas you can find that the market doesn't even see because it is myopic.\n- Hyperbolic discounting - everybody wants to double their money in two 3 years - if you want to double your money in ten years, you have an advantage and you will likely double it in 5, buy you must keep targeting doubling it in ten, not five. that is crucial. \n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "title": "Dollar Cost Averaging vs. Lump Sum Investing Strategy!",
            "description": "What is the best stock market investment strategy to deploy money is the ultimate question to be answered, if you have money of course. Most people think about whether to deploy it all immediately (LUMP SUM INVESTING) or to stage the purchases over a period of time (DOLLAR COST AVERAGING). Vanguard and other research shows that you'll do better with a lump-sum investment in 70% of cases and better with dollar cost averaging in 30% of cases. So, it is up to you what kind of odds do you wish to bet on. \nHowever, you know I will not give you just the stock market investing statistics. By discussing the difference between investing and speculating; the difference between lump sum investing where you invest when you have the money and when a financial instrument fits your required return and dollar cost averaging, where you are more concerned about the market as you try to time it we will also touch on what really matters for the long-term. \nAnother point is discussing the importance of buying the bottom in the market - some stocks are up 50% since March 22, but how much does that change their investment quality? You'll be surprised how important it is! The importance of timing the market will also give you the answer when it comes to investing it all in a lump-sum or dollar cost average over time.\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "description": "Disney stock analysis for 2020. Disney stock (NYSE: DIS) offers a share in a great business and the recent stock drop might make it a good buying opportunity. If is funny that Warren Buffett did buy Disney in 1966, a 5% stake for $4 million that would be worth today north of $10 billion. However, he sold in 1967 for a 50% profit in just a year. He figured he is paying just for the park while all the other things are for free; the brand, future growth etc. \nToday, if we analyze what Disney is, each business individually, especially if we compare to Netflix, just Disney+ could cover for the whole market capitalization. Enjoy the discussion with Disney's business overview, fundamental analysis, absolute investment perspective, Disney stock predictions and a relative investment perspective into Disney stock.\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "description": "Oil stocks are a buy now because oil prices will come back to a supply and demand average balance. So, oil stocks that survive the year with huge oversupply will do good and pay good dividends in the future. Look for value and avoid risky plays with a lot of debt.\nAt current levels 68% of US oil production is completely unfeasible and just that would remove 8 mb/d from supply and correct the price if the situation persists over a year. So, the average long-term price of oil will be higher than $30.\n\nOn stocks - we have to differentiate between rebound buys and long-term investments. Exxon XOM will likely rebound as oil prices go up and the oil price war ends, but their growth strategy might not work well over the long-term as a small decline in demand might lead to long-term oversupply. This adds to the risk. Similarly, creditors have shows confidence in the sector by giving Shell (RDS) $12 billion in credit so the dividends can keep coming. But, taking on debt to pay a dividend is simply stupid in my opinion. Lundin Petroleum can break-even at $17, the Russians have similar costs when it comes to producing so there are companies that will make money no matter the environment. \nEnjoy the discussion for more info.\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

However, if you are an optimist like me, you know it will end one day and the world will be a better place.

In any case, Delta, United and Southwest offer a yield of about 8% to shareholders and can be considered fairly priced. American airlines stock is a bet with a positive risk reward but keep in mind it went bust twice recently.\n\nDon't forget to check my Boeing stock analysis too! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9GOoa7IOZE\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

            "description": "The topic of the stock market news today is the extreme money abundance in the economic and financial system. We have been enjoying 10 years of constant money printing and zero interest rates. The FED has restarted to print money and the ECB too. \nIn such an environment it is logical that stocks keep going up and there is nothing we can do about it. We should not even fight the trend, we should accept it, take advantage of it, no matter how irrational it is.\nHowever, when it comes to investing, the key is to always keep it low risk, high reward so that whatever happens, you don't lose, but if things go well you win big.\nWe can't predict the future but what we can do is focus on fundamentals and value investing - hope this stock market news video helps!\n\nWant to know more about my research and portfolios?

Per Jenster and Peter Barklin at the Niche Masters fund.\nhttp://nichemastersfund.com\n\nThe index fund bubble explained \n\nThe index fund bubble can be defined only after and if it pops. If the index fund bubble doesn't pop, it is not and will never be a bubble. Your index fund investment returns will be determined by fundamentals, nothing else. \n\nIndex fund investing – Passive better than active\n\nFundamentals are also crucial when deciding whether to go passive and invest in index funds or be an active investor. The key is to compare the risks and rewards of any investment opportunity so that you can see what to expect.\n\nWhat to expect from index funds over the long-term\n\nThe S&P 500 index fund will probably deliver 5% yearly returns over the long-term. That is good, but it might not be linear and you can see crashes like in 2009 or 2002 of 50%. Keep that in mind and see how it fits your financial goals.\n\nIndex funds - greed and fear\nFocus on fundamentals, not greed and fear - usually the biggest mistake index funds investors make. \nA good index fund investing for beginners strategy would be to invest automatically on a monthly basis. Low cost Vanguard Index funds is all you need - but you have to stick to it long-term.\nLong-term outlook – Index fund risk and reward scenarios  are what matters and you have to see how various scenarios would affect you personally.\n\nHow to invest – index funds or stocks?\nSee how much you can put into investing, how much time and what can you take in volatility. Focus on quality, long-term sustainability and superior returns. At the moment index funds have the first two, not the third.\nInvesting vs Index fund compounding – 5%, 7%, 10% or more! Index funds will compound at 5%, that is good, don't expect more than 5% from the current level. But if you aim for higher and get to it, magic can be made!\n\n#indexfunds #indexfundsbubble #stockmarket",

            "description": "12 Best Stock Market Investing Books \n\nSeth Klarman - Margin of Safety - https://amzn.to/3qaPyXU\nAvailable on Amazon for amounts between $800 and $2000 but try googling it😊. This is the book for every value investor as it discusses eternal knowledge by comparing it to the current market fads. Even if the book was published in 1991, you will be able to compare the described market patterns to many current irrational environments. A must read for all investors!\n\nAlice Schroeder – The Snowball - https://amzn.to/2IY1I5J\nA detailed description of the complexity of what Warren Buffett has done over the last 50 years. A long read with 700 pages but well worth it, it is 700 pages of business wisdom.\n\nBenjamin Graham – The Intelligent Investor https://amzn.to/2K1L1Tc\n\nLast edition written in 1972 but full of knowledge like to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. There is a full video summary of the book that I made here:\nBenjamin Graham – The Intelligent Investor Video Summary \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ_xAEt09C0&list=PLBmr55S1qNIUPz4INcUmqW97GjiJruUAi\n\nNassim Taleb – The Black Swan https://amzn.to/2YgXuYq\n\nWhen it comes to investing, nobody can forecast the future. Therefore, it is good to know how to probabilistically assess what is going on, be ready for anything and be ready to take advantage when crazy things, like the 2008 financial meltdown, happen. Taleb add huge value for all investors by teaching us how to expect the unexpected and be prepared for it. \n\nDaniel Kahneman – Thiking Slow And Fast https://amzn.to/2K0tVFs\nHard read but full of knowledge to grasp how your mind actually works and why do you to certain things. \n\nJim Rogers – Hot Commodities https://amzn.to/2K1NZHk\nAn ok book, but worth a mention because is one of the few that discusses commodities.\n\nGlen Arnold – The Great Investors https://amzn.to/2yeeJ1H\nAmazing summaries of the greatest investors’ investing styles: Buffett, Munger, Templeton, Fisher, Lynch, Soros, etc. Excellent way to start and find the best style for you or to add some valuable tools to your existing investing arsenal. \n\nTony Robbins – Money, Master The Game https://amzn.to/2YhMxpi\nNot a book about Tony Robbins, but about the interviews. \n\nSven Carlin – Modern Value Investing https://amzn.to/2K3Z6iY\nGraham wrote his book in 1972, Klarman in 1991, so there was a need to summarize and update value investing knowledge. The 25 tools help with the practical approach while the other two parts of the book help with the investing mindset.\n\nMohnish Pabrai – The Dhando Investor https://amzn.to/2LEeBkW\nAn excellent story on how real business investing is done with a margin of safety, no risk and huge upside. Actually, real investors take no risks and make huge gains!\n\nJack Schwager – Market Wizzards https://amzn.to/2JMtuiW\nA book about trading, interviewing the best traders, which is crucial to better understand how the markets work, understand risk and also the potential reward.\n\nWant to know more about what I do? \nFull-time independent stock market analyst and researcher!\nSTOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM (analysis, stocks to buy, model portfolio)\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nInexpensive monthly stock idea and analysis:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-ideas-and-analyses-for-the-small-investor\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter for a weekly content overview and articles with stock analyses: http://eepurl.com/dyBX5L\n\nCheck my website to hear more about me, read my analyses and about OUR charity.

            "description": "Alacer Gold Stock Analysis - I sold Alacer recently not because it turned bad, but because it is not really a value investment anymore. Whatever I invest in, value investing is the best, be it gold, gold miners are whatever.\n\nIn 2018 I did a comprehensive analysis of gold miners, I spent more than a month on them and deeply researched about 40. I wasn't pleased with what I found but Alacer Gold (ALIAF) (ALACF) looked good. We can say it was my favorite gold miner in 2018 as it was not just a bet on gold, but a value play with a nice business proposition thanks to the Copler sulfide project. \n\nSince then things have changed, most significantly the stock price increased as the market noticed what ALIAF has been doing.\n\n\nAs the exploration results led to a new resource that would feed the old oxide plant, the managed increased guidance and said ALIAF could become a 300k to 400k ounces producer. \n\nHowever, the path towards such high production levels is long and the ore grades of the sulfide ore aren't really indicative of high, sustainable future production. But this doesn't mean there are no catalysts for ALIAF or that it now is a bad investment. the catalysts that could push it higher in 2019 are a dividend or buybacks, new successful exploration results and higher gold prices. \n\nFor me, when the stock price increases and reaches my intrinsic value, the risks are higher and the rewards lower so I prefer to find other, less risky, investments.\n\nWant to know more about what I do? \nFull-time independent stock market analyst and researcher!\nSTOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM (analysis, stocks to buy, model portfolio)\nhttps://goo.gl/MQG2k5 \n\nInexpensive monthly stock idea and analysis:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-ideas-and-analyses-for-the-small-investor\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nSubscribe to my newsletter for a weekly content overview and articles with stock analyses: https://svencarlin.com\n\nListen to Modern Value Investing Podcast:\nhttps://svencarlin.com/podcasts/",

            "description": "An item that costs $1 today, cost $0.04 in 1913... Want to take advantage of inflation and increase returns?\n\nAs investors, we can take advantage and profit from inflation. Here are the best 2 ways to do so.\n\nWith current interest rates, this is one of the best protectors against inflation. \n\nA 30-year fixed mortgage. \n\nWith current interest rates around 4.5% in the US, it's an excellent hedge against inflation. Why?\n\nThe value of real estate goes up with inflation, a fixed mortgage rate doesn't. You win.\n\nWant to win for the 2nd time?\n\nYou can do so by owning good businesses. \nGood businesses can increase their prices, which impact you. Higher prices mean higher profits, thus higher dividends. You win again.\n\nInflation can be high or low, but nonetheless, it diminishes the value of your currency. By keeping an open mind, you can do the opposite and make inflation our friend.\n\nWant to know more about what I do? \nFull-time independent stock market analyst and researcher!\nSTOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM (analysis, stocks to buy, model portfolio)\nhttps://goo.gl/MQG2k5 \n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nLike Modern Value Investing Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CarlinSven\n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/svencarlin/\n\nListen to Modern Value Investing Podcast:\nhttps://svencarlin.com/podcasts/\n\nI am also learning a lot by interning with my mentors: dr.

You can balance one like Dalio, among different asset classes or you can go Buffett style and have lots of cash when the economy is hot. Buffett will use that cash to buy stocks when the economy is in a recession.

            "title": "CONVERTIBLE BONDS EXPLAINED - TESLA CONVERTIBLE BOND EXAMPLE",
            "description": "What is a convertible bond!\n\nA convertible bond is a debt instrument issued by a company in order to get financing. The company will pay a periodic interest rate on the borrowed amount and, like any other bond, the bond has a maturity date. But, unlike other bonds, the holder of the bond can choose between getting his money back or, converting his bonds for a pre-set number of shares in the company or common stocks. The decision depends on the value of the shares in that moment. If the market value of the shares is higher than the bond principal, it is better to convert.

Revenue deceleration\nAm I buying the stock now?\n\nFacebook stock price (NASDAQ: FB) questions are running all over the internet in these days. What I want to discuss here is: why is Facebook’s stock down, I’ll show you a few earnings and valuation models that explain the movement in Facebook’s stock price, I’ll give you its fair valuation based on growth and I’ll give you the perspective of a practitioner, as I have been recently testing a bit with Facebook ads for my book and stock market research platform, which might be a bit more positive for the stock than what others show. The Cambridge Analytica scandal will have an impact but the question is how much will revenue growth decelerate?\nWe’ll finish with a discussion on whether Facebook is a buy now and whether will I buy this for my model portfolio. Also, why is Facebook better than Amazon's stock.\n\nWhat do I do?

The technology will probably be an important part of our future and that is why companies like IMB\nBlockchain stocks to invest in\nHere I want to show something I already discussed in the how I find stocks video but I find it so important to differential between the scams and real companies doing business. An interesting company that used to be called Long Island Tea Company with the ticker LTEA, changed its name into Long Blockchain corporation and the ticker into LBCC as the management’s idea was to mine cryptocurrencies or something. Interest for the stock exploded but it soon become clear it was just a hype or better to say scam.\n \nThe stock is now trading at 30 cents in comparison to the $9.49 that was the high achieved toward the end of 2017. \nBest way to invest in blockchain\nOn the other hand, some serious stocks like IBM are investing and developing the blockchain technology.\n \nHowever, IBM’s stock price didn’t explode because it suddenly became a blockchain stock.\n \nThe point here is that it will take time for the technology to develop and if I get this right, the point of the technology is to lower costs of doing things and financial transactions. If you lower costs, margins are lower and blockchain stocks should make less money. The general economy could do better but there is not really a direct way to take advantage of the blockchain technology by investing in blockchain stocks.\n\nWhat do I do?

            "description": "This pension fund investing strategy is for a Canadian customer that asked for my help when it comes to her pension fund investing and the unfortunately limited options she has in her pension plan. \n\nThe options are really limited but you have to do what you can with what you have. In order to help with the extremely important pension investing strategy I did some research and the more I researched the more pissed I became as I couldn’t believe what I found.\n\nTHE FEES CHARGED BY PENSION MUTUAL FUNDS ARE OUTRAGEOUS\n\nThe bulk of a mutual fund is invested in cash and the management fee is 1%. The management expense ratio is at 0.56% but strange that it is below the fee.\n\nIf you don’t want to be a 70 year old waiter serving those rich money managers, it is time for Canadians to step up and do something, if not you will be working as a 70-year old bust boy or girl on Vancouver Island serving the fund managers’ and their kids that are living the rich life spending your pension! \n\nA 2% will probably lower your pension by 30%! The things to do are to contact Justin Trudeau and change the pension system or create a new pension fund for yourself where you take responsibility for your retirement.\n\nWhat do I do?

            "title": "HOW TO INVEST IN STOCKS, SVEN CARLIN Ph.D",
            "description": "Investing in stocks requires answering the following questions:\n\nHow to invest money in stocks? \nHow much money to invest in stocks?\nWhat are the best stocks to buy?\nHow to find the best stocks to buy?\nHow do I protect myself from a stock market crash?\nWhat are the best stocks to invest in?\nShould I invest in penny stocks? Should I invest in bitcoin? Should I invest in blockchain?\nHow to invest in stocks on your own?\n\nHOW TO INVEST MONEY IN STOCKS? HOW MUCH MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS?\n\nWhat I do is, I invest money in my stock market portfolio on a month by month basis. I have a model stock portfolio that I started with $10 thousand and I add $1 thousand every month no matter what. I do not necessarily buy with all the money that I add, that depends on the opportunities in the market, more about how I find opportunities and track them later.\nMy goal is for this stock market portfolio to be at $1 million in 20 years. This will be achieved if I reach an investment return of 12% per year. I believe, this can be achieved with proper research, good risk reward analysis and proper portfolio diversification. Investors that I admire like Klarman, Buffett, Schloss, have achieved even higher returns than 12% over the very long term. Other value investors are steadily above 15% which shows that this can be done over the long term.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BEST STOCKS TO BUY?\n\nThe best stocks to buy are those with good businesses that lead to growing earnings, cash flows and dividends over time no matter what is going on with the economy or stock market. \n\nHOW TO FIND THE BEST STOCKS TO BUY?\n\nHere it all boils down to research, looking for the best businesses, following sectors that are cheap at the moment due to temporary reasons. \n\nSTOCK MARKET CRASH PROTECTION\n\nOn stock market crash protections, you have to see when do you need the money and then balance between cash and investing. Stocks to expensive, have more cash and then balance as the market always fluctuates.\n\nSHOULD I INVEST IN PENNY STOCKS OR BITCOIN?\n\nPenny stocks and cryptocurrencies attract lots of people because big money can be made there fast due to the high volatility. However, that is speculation and you depend on someone paying more than what you paid. \n\nHOW TO INVEST IN BLOCKCHAIN?\n\nTo invest in the technology you are looking at long term investments in companies like IBM. There is even an IBM blockchain page. \n\nHOW TO INVEST IN STOCKS ON YOUR OWN?\n\nThe first thing to know is to understand all the terms related to stocks and investing, all the accounting factors (I have to make a course accounting for investors, will come but I can’t promise when), read as many books as you can (we have made a summary of the intelligent investor here) and there is also my book, and give yourself time to learn. Invest the money you can afford to lose as tuition, you learn much better with real money.\n\nWhat do I do?

            "title": "MY PERFECT STOCK PORTFOLIO - SVEN CARLIN PH.D.",
            "description": "STOCK MARKET PORTFOLIO\n\nInvesting in stocks means you end up with a portfolio as having only one stock is too risky because you never know what might happen. Today, we’ll discuss MY PERFECT PORTFOLIO and 5 things to watch when building a portfolio in 2018!\n\nDo you have a good investment portfolio? \nDo you know what is portfolio management? \nHow to manage your portfolio?\nDoes it allow you to take advantage of the opportunities that might come in today’s finance environment? \nIs it hedged in a way? \n\nI’ll try to answer those questions by showing how I go about portfolio strategy and the 5 key factors to watch when building a portfolio!\n\nBEST STOCK PORTFOLIO FOR 2018\n\nWe often discuss stocks, news, certain sectors but what is the perfect stock market portfolio in 2018? As I am building a Model Portfolio for my Stock Market Platform, I think a video on how to build a portfolio today would be really good. We don’t talk enough about portfolio management and how would my perfect portfolio look at this point in time!\n\nWHAT IS A GREAT PORTFOLIO?\n\nA stock portfolio is a combination of various stocks that will lead you to satisfying investment returns no matter what happens in the economy and financial markets. \n\n5 KEY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT THINGS TO WATCH:\n\nWhether you only have a google finance portfolio or an actual money portfolio this exercise will help you understand the risk and reward you’re your stock market investments.\n\n1) VALUE SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF YOUR PORTFOLIO\n\nIn an environment of low inflation, sky high stock prices, a long term investor has to keep his focus on value. What will be the things people will use also in a recession and what will be the technologies that will grow no matter what. Having value gives you protection from inflation and in case that stock prices drop you know you can easily buy more.\n \n2) PORTFOLIO VALUATION IS KEY\n\nYour long term returns depend on the earnings the stocks you have in your portfolio generate. If you can build a portfolio with better valuations but great assets, you will reach great financial results! Fortunately, there are great investing opportunities if you are willing to look for them.\n\n3) MANAGE THE RISK OF YOUR PORTFOLIO\n\nThe stock market is usually very volatile, especially if you look at specific sectors. That is why you have to give yourself time to buy and prepare a portfolio. A few years, a healthy economic cycle, some market panics should do the trick. So, what I am doing with my model portfolio will take a bit to set up as it is a process and we have to wait for investment opportunities to come to us. Chasing stocks and buying just because it looks nice in a portfolio, simply increases the risk and lowers long term portfolio returns.\n\n4) MY PERFECT PORTFOLIO EXPOSURE\n\nThe perfect portfolio exposure depends on volatility and risk and also hedges! It also depends on the risk reward of each position at the current moment so it is really a process through time, real portfolio management. But to give you an idea of how I see this at this moment in time, here it is:\n\nGREAT BUSINESSES ACROSS:\n20% DEVELOPED markets and global \n8% LATAM\n8% CHINA\n8% ASIA (incl. Russia)\n8% HEDGES & GOLD\n8% REAL ESTATE \n15% COMMODITIES\n25% - CASH AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThis will be around 20 stocks and a lot of those would be mixes. Further this does not include the cash balances in each position depending on the current opportunities and risk reward. Some stocks get hit extremely hard during a recession, while some simply continue to grow thanks to their amazing technology.\n\n5) PORTFOLIO RISK AND REWARD\n\nIn the long term, when it comes to stock market investing and portfolio management, even if only 5 things of 10 things only go right – the point is that you can make so much money on those five, if you do things properly, that you will not care about the losses. It is not rare that good stocks go up 10 or 50 times in a decade or two (multibagger stocks) that are the drivers of your portfolio returns. Careful risk reward portfolio management allows you to take advantage of such stocks.\nPortfolio management – it is about risk reward and value!\n\nWhat do I do?

            "description": "Should I invest in stocks? \n\nInvesting in stocks is a positive sum game. By being careful in what you invest in, you can reap many positive returns just from how things work in this world. The economy, other people, trade and technology all work in your favor.\n\nWhat should I invest in?\n\nThe key is to invest in things that will do well over time no matter what. Stocks benefit from economic growth, their business earnings create your returns, and over the long term you are protected from inflation.\n\nWhy should I invest?\n\nExcept from protecting yourself from inflation, if you don’t invest, the value of your money is eaten away slowly day by day. You need $25 today to purchase what you could had bought with $1 back in 1913. On top of everything, the global economy will continue to grow and develop, stock earnings will grow and your dividends will grow.\n\nHow much should I invest?\n\nThat is personal, but even a small amount will develop a habit, which is the key for long term investing success.\n\nWhat stocks should I invest in?\n\nYou can invest in mutual funds, which is a good option if you don’t want to think and look for better investment opportunities. If you are willing to put some effort, you can find better and better investments that protect your capital and give you higher returns over the long term.\n\nShould I invest in bitcoin?\n\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies is the opposite of investing in stocks. Stocks have dividends which lead to positive returns, stocks are parts of businesses that own assets that generate profits. Those assets protect you from inflation. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum only depend on whether somebody is willing to pay more for them and there is a hefty fee related to every transaction that makes it a negative sum game. This can be seen by the big swings in cryptocurrency prices, an example is the ripple price.\n\nWhat should I invest in 2018?\n\nThe key when investing is to create a portfolio of assets that are going to do the work for you but where you will also be diversified. This means that you should look to build your investment portfolio over time. More about that in tomorrow’s video about my portfolio.\n\nWhat do I do? Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com",

A few decades ago, we used to call such behaviour communist. There are a few very dangerous things developing:\n\n\n1) Not thinking when investing in the stock market is not good because you fail to learn and develop – miss on so many other investing opportunities!\n2) By not taking responsibility for your own financial wellbeing – you’ll get the average!\n3) Financial atrophy!\n4) What has worked in the past 3 decades will not work in the next 3!\n5) It is extremely possible to beat the market – especially this market (S&P 500) – and it is even easier to reach amazing investing returns overall in a life!",

            "description": "This amazing 1962 Warren Buffett interview shows how when investing, nothing has changed for the last 65 years except of the fact that Buffett now uses a language more people can understand.\nStocks and the stock market are the same, the only thing we can do is to look at our actions. This is what lead Buffett to the amazing success with Berkshire Hathaway.\nThe key point to grasp is that if stocks go up for no reason, those might also go down for no reason, especially if corporate earnings do not improve. And, S&P 500 earnings haven’t gone far over the last 10- 12 years.\n “We may have seen the last of it or not” – and this has been his mantra for the whole of his life – he cannot know what the market will do, the only thing he can do is look at businesses and estimate earnings.\nThat is exactly what I do but unlike Buffett I also like to look more in emerging markets – he is from the U.S. , I am from emerging markets – at this moment in time I think I have an advantage from my domestic bias. Keep watching for more interesting investments insights and stock analyses -  the next sectors I’ll  be analyzing in debt are emerging markets! Brazil and Argentina.\n\nWhat do I do?

            "title": "HOW AND WHEN TO INVEST IN SOLAR - STOCK MARKET NEWS",
            "description": "Link to research platform: \nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/\n\nLink to FSLR:\n\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/courses/stock-market-research-platform/lectures/5213427\n\nYou can read the full article here: \nhttps://allweatherinvestments.com/2018/06/18/solar-stocks-carnage-cyclicality-explained/\n\nStock market news – Solar stocks carnage – Cyclicality explained!\nThe three main educational take outs of this article are: cyclicality, market sentiment (analysts) and action (when to invest).\nWe’ll discuss the above while analyzing the solar sector and the recent decline.\n\nI have been researching the solar sector for a few weeks now and am coming to an end. What is interesting is that since I started researching the sector in depth, sentiment towards solar stocks has completely changed. Stocks like First Solar (FSLR), SolarEdge (SEDG) and SMA Solar (SMA) went from being the darlings of the market to being the most hated stocks out there.\nWhat is incredible is how quickly can sentiment change and consequently how hardly can the respective stocks be hit. It is so important to look at what happened because there is so much to learn about how cyclicality works and how vulnerable are businesses that have no moats. \nWhat happened in the solar sector?\nUp till mid-May all looked well for solar stocks, California made it mandatory for new homes to have solar panels from 2020, FSLR was announcing production increases alongside new production plants and on May 10, 2018, J.P. Morgan even upgraded FSLR by increasing its price target from $75 to $85 based on the market-leading Series 6 product.\nI am always wary of investing in such a bullish environment and good news because if you take a look at the longer-term stock price charts, you can see that the current stock prices are not far from where they were just a while ago.\nWhat happened is that many investors got carried away by the flow of good news and strong earnings during the first months of 2018, they forgot that the solar industry is extremely cyclical where supply gaps can quickly turn into supply gluts. \nThe first big hit was when China announced the suspension of solar quotas and subsidies cuts in order to put the exploding industry under control. Tariffs on electricity generated from clean energy have been lowered by 0.05 yuan per kilowatt hour, a cut of 6.7% to 9% depending on the region.\nThis is what triggered the spiral of downgrades for solar stocks. Bank of America Merril Lynch lowered its FSLR price target from $85 to $63 on expected margin contraction where the halt in Chinese installations will potentially lead to a global oversupply of panels and lower prices. It is funny that the same bank upgraded the stock just two months ago.\nJMP downgraded FSLR form $87 to $46 and Goldman lowered its price target from $75 to $48 based on 40% lower volume expectations in China.\nIn my analysis of FSLR that you can read here, I have estimated cyclicality which gave me a much lower valuation than what other bullish analysts were seeing. \nI might even have to lower the peak earnings there a bit but when you look at it from the long term, the most important thing to understand is that the solar panel industry and related sectors, is and will always be cyclical. When solar panel prices are high and FSLR can have a 35% gross profit margin, many others flock in to take a bite out of such a delicious pie. Given the regulatory and subsidy risks, we can call such a sector as unstable. \nWhen and how to invest in solar stocks?\nWhen investing you have two options. You can invest only after there is a stream of good news, analysts’ upgrades, strong earnings and guidance, or you can invest when a sector gets in trouble. The risks for the first option is that some bad news quickly put you in the red, as it happened lately with solar stocks. There is also the fear of missing out as some have been preaching FSLR to go to $140. \nThe key message here is that in order to invest in something, one must have a clear long-term view of the sector, the long-term earnings potential and take advantage of market irrationalities surrounding the environment. The only way to have more confidence in your decisions is to have clear value models for each stock and invest only when the stock comes to you and is below your intrinsic value in order to give you a margin of safety.\n\nWhat do I do?

As I offer stock market research services you can put me into both the investor and advisors group. Let’s first see what Graham has to say and then discuss the current environment. \n\nSeeking investment advice\nDifferentiate between stock market forecasts and business forecasts\nAdvice from brokerage houses\nGraham on investment bankers\n\nAs Graham is in favor of investing in businesses he considers seeking investing advice as naïve. Relying on other people to make investment profits for you is not always the best thing to do. There are two different investment advices you can get: one is there to protect you from doing stupid things while you might also seek advice that will give you better than average investment returns. \nGraham’s message is simple: you either let somebody else manage your funds and seek a conservative return or you understand the implications behind more complex investment strategies that might lead to higher returns.\nDifferentiate between stock market forecasts and business forecasts\nAs there is plenty of demand for what people think the market is going to do, there is plenty of supply for that but according to Graham there is absolutely no value there as market forecasters are right or wrong merely thanks to luck. Where there is value is business forecasts which are a completely different ball game. \nWhen you know the business and apply Graham’s principle that the price what you pay in relation to the business you buy is the key factor, then business analyses add value. \nAdvice from brokerage houses\nI think nothing has changed there since Graham’s time where I quote: “Most stock-exchange houses still adhere to the old-time slogans that they are in business to make commissions and give the customer what they want.” \nI also see that the current financial environment is geared so much towards trading where such houses keep making their commissions. Even if the average commission is much lower today, the number of trades is much, much higher than it was and you can trade a stock 10 times in a day if you want.\nGraham’s take on the matter is that you have to seek value minded and not quotation-minded analysts to help you. If you focus on the former, you will do much better in your financial life.\nGraham on investment bankers\nGraham takes is simple: investment bankers are needed to create a stock market but when their customers are greedy they also offer what the customer demands. An example of such imprudent advice are 1999 IPOs, 2006 CDOs etc. So, always keep an open eye with such vehicles. \nConclusion\nMy main wish is that everybody takes responsibility for one’s own financial life and a great way to do that is to read Graham’s book. If one does not have time, today it is easy and cheap to be a defensive investor where one simply rebalances between risk free bonds and stocks depending on their earnings yield. \nThose who have more time will educate themselves about investing and seek advice form others not in the form of what to do but in the form of research, analysis and a value, business oriented opinion.\nRemember, nobody knows whether a stock will go up or down, but there are people who can properly analyze a business. In the long term, business analysis is all what you need.",

            "description": "What do I do? Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nCheck the comparative stock list table on my Stock market research platform under curriculum preview!\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore about me and some written reports at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nStock market for modern value investors Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/modernvalueinvesting/\n\nHere is summary of the most important investing thoughts related to investing in the current environment. \n\n1) Look at the businesses you own and their earnings, not the stock\nIt is so easy and entertaining to look at stock prices constantly go up and down. However, real investing is concerned with comparing the intrinsic value of the business and its earnings with what the stock market is offering. When the stock market offers bargain prices, you buy, when the stock market offers exuberant prices, you sell. This is the main premise if you want to make investing easy. \nFor example, the current earnings yield of the S&P 500, that represents the top 500 quoted U.S. businesses is 4.08%.\n\nThere will be ups and downs with corporate earnings but if you are happy with a long term yearly return of around 4% and happy to own the best American businesses you should invest in the S&P 500. \nIf you would like to own the best American businesses but expect at least a 6% return to mitigate the risk of owning stocks that can always drop 50% in a year, you should simply wait and be invested in Treasuries, possibly short-term Treasuries that give you a good return and security. It is as simple as that if you are happy with a normal average return. If you want better returns than 3% from Treasuries or 4% for stocks or even from 6% you could get if you wait for stocks to fall, then you have to think about the following things.\n2) Understand what you are doing but again it boils down to business execution\nIf you seek higher returns you have to have as much knowledge as possible about the matter. However, if you want to do it with the minimal risk possible, you have to again become a specialist in business analysis, not the stock market. \nYou might look at stocks like Tencent that are up 500% over the last 5-years and wish you had bought it earlier. \n\nHowever, TCEHY’s revenue increased exactly 5.5 times since 2012 and earnings increased 5.46 times. Therefore, the performance of a stock over the long term is determined by its business execution, when you learn how to estimate businesses, you will be great at investing if you keep in mind some other stuff.\n3) Invest with a margin of safety and think value\nValue investing has beaten growth investing 94% of the time when we look at 10-year investing returns. Therefore, always keep in mind that whatever happens on financial markets is usually temporary while only the real assets, cash production and actual value stay and add value over the longer term. More about this topic here.\n4) Look beyond what others are doing – use common sense\nYou don’t necessarily need to be a contrarian to be a great investor but it sure helps to look where other people aren’t looking because sooner or later it will become the focus, be it in a positive or negative light. \nThe key is to look at long term average returns for the industry and invest when those are satisfying to you. For example, if you see an apartment close to a good University that yields 5% after all expenses are paid and you are happy with the yield invest in it. Further, with inflation, both the retn you are charging will be increased year over year and the value of the apartment should appreciate which might increase the 5% return over time. But, don’t wait that everybody is crazy about student housing and the yield drops to 3%. \nThe main message here is to use common sense and look at the return on investments. Forget about promises but keep you eyes open for grounded investments that provide a good return.\n5) Sometimes swing for the fences\nWhen you apply the above 4 principles to your investing portfolio you will do well. However, to keep things interesting you should risk a set of yearly dividends in something that is risky to the degree that you can lose 100% if it doesn’t work out but gain 1,000% if it works out well. Such a risk reward asymmetry is called positive risk reward and is often mispriced by the market. The key here is not to get greedy and invest too much into such trends and also do not invest in the late part of the trend, find it before other people find something like that. Just to give you a hint related to something not yet coming from Elon Musk but that might soon come is Vanadium.",

The deal valued the company at $150 billion and this is an excellent example to show how the little investor gets screwed. \nAccording to Reuters, investors are Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and state investor Temasek Holdings (Private), as well as U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. So, mostly private and well positioned specific firms invest now, before the IPO. But, let’s take a look at what has been going on.\nYahoo, Alibaba & Ant Financial\nIf you have a pension fund, it probably owned shares of Yahoo that consequently owned part Alibaba. You might think that as Alibaba founded Ant Financial you would also indirectly own 100% of it. But that is not the case, in 2012 Jack Ma spun out Ant Financial out of Alibaba to himself and Yahoo managed to make a deal where Alibaba has a right to 37.5% of profits that can be exchanged to a 33% stake. So, here is the first part the average Joe got screwed by Jack Ma himself. \nThe Ant Financial IPO\nThe last financing round showed how a company raises $10 billion in cash at an absurd valuation in its final valuation round and only afterwards it will be offered to other investors. This means that when you buy through a fund or an index fund you are really the last investor in the chain. Most of the companies that invested in the last financing round will probably sell to eager pension fund managers after the IPO, get a nice return and leave the long-term risk to little investors hoping to retire.\nIf Anf Financial IPOs at $300 billion that would be a 100% return for the investors investing in the last financing round and a 500% return for those who invested in the previous round in 2016 that valued the company at $60 billion. As Ant Financial’s pre tax profit was $1.8 billion for 2017, the current pre-tax valuation is already 83 while the future IPO valuation might be double this one. \nThat is how the financial world works. Make sure you are not always the last in the line getting the crumbs. It will change your financial life. However, don’t also chase crazy risks that you don’t understand. The key lies in the knowledge, the more you know, the better will be your risk adjusted returns. When you have knowledge you will be able to understand things like the following.",

Today, we’ll discuss what happened last week and differentiate between what is nonsense and what is really important. The talk of the day was about Italy, trade wars but the key lies in the structural risks that are piling up again as it was the case back in the 2000s. \nIf we take a look at the S&P 500 over the week on Tuesday there was a big selloff due to Italian panic that was completely forgotten on Wednesday. \n\nWe have also had lots of various news year to date but that hasn’t impacted markets at all. Year to date the stock market is up 2.28%.\nHowever, the key is that the S&P 500 is up 68% over the past 5 years which is an amazing performance and one should question whether it is just a bit riskier now. Klarman, Munger, Buffett and other value investors see risk as a function of price and nothing else. Something to keep in mind on a daily basis.\n\nOn Tuesday it was about how Rome ruined markets\nAnd the point is that people actually sold on the news – \nThe next day all back to normal\nIn all this turmoil with Italy this is a piece of info that is important.

Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nCheck the comparative stock list table on my Stock market research platform under curriculum preview!\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore about me and some written reports at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nStock market for modern value investors Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/modernvalueinvesting/\n\nThe main difference between index funds investing today and in Graham’s time are the fees which in some cases were up to 9% entry fee back then while now you can buy a market fund with a yearly asset management fee of 0.04%. Further, at his time there weren’t any actual index funds that are the key investment vehicle at the moment, especially if an ETF.\nGraham on mutual funds\nGraham believes that the average investor does better by investing in funds rather than investing is stocks directly as funds promote the “good habits of savings and investing”. Those good habits are unfortunately not promoted by ETFs as the only purpose of those is to be tradable which is something you don’t want to do when you are a defensive investor and own a fund. \nFunds’ performance\nWhat is interesting is that the funds analyzed by Graham performed better than the Dow Jones index and in line with the S&P 500. However, when digging deeper and analyzing the best performers he points how some of the managers took undue speculative risks to reach those results which is something investors should be careful about. \nGraham further describes the typical stock market story where funds always set out to beat the market and the handful that do attract even more capital that allows them to continue to do so for a while. When the opposite happens, such funds are usually mergered into other funds so you don’t even hear about those anymore. \nSomething similar is going on with current markets where index funds did really well and as money keeps coming in, those continue to do well. However, Graham describes such performance by using a French quote:\n“Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose”\nThat literarily means: “The more it changes the more it is the same “.\nApplying this to the new environment, as index funds keep going up, I am scared of what it will look like when the 35 year trend reverts. \nBuy closed end funds\nIf you want to invest in funds Graham’s take is to buy closed end funds that cannot take anymore financing and thus focus on performance. Needles to say, one such fund is Berkshire. Further, you should buy only at 10% to 15% discount to asset value. In the case of BRK this should be at around 1.2 of book value as much of BRK’s value is not on the books. \nBack to index funds\nSo, according to Graham, if we must buy actively managed funds we should buy discounted closed end funds in order to get value when we buy. As index funds weren’t yet introduced back then we can only estimate what would Graham’s take be on them but given Graham’s preference for a simple 75% to 25% stock bond allocation for the defensive investor what would make it even easier it using an index fund like the S&P 500. When stocks are expensive you hold more bonds and vice versa. \nAs the price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is now 24.87 implying a long term earnings yield of 4% we could say stocks are expensive as the 2-year Treasury bond yields 2.57% at no risk. Further, corporate earnings are stretched thanks to tax benefits and 8 years of economic expansion and low interest rates.\nFigure 1 S&P 500 price to earnings ratio \nSource: Multpl\n4% at high risk as the S&P 500 can easily go down to 1,500 points versus 2.57% at no risk is a good question to answer where each one of us has to make.\nNevertheless, if we return to Grahams key investing habits of saving and investing on a monthly basis you should actually rejoice a stock market crash as you would be able to buy more and have a higher dividend yield and return on investment over time. \nConclusion\nI am not usually saying that index funds are bad but simply that the risk at current levels is too high for the returns and the lower yielding Treasury is better from a risk reward perspective than an index funds. I think Graham would agree as stocks were extremely expensive for him in 1971 where we can see above the price to earnings ratio was close to 19.",

BYD looks healthier.\n\nThe technology is close to being profitable.\nThis will not only boost the industry but also renewables.\nKnowing what is going on is key to profitable investing.\n\nAt the current moment solar is doing really good with the latest positive news being the state of California making it mandatory to install solar roofs on now houses by 2020. However, solar and wind energy, the drivers of renewable energy are both very volatile and not producing most of the energy when it is needed. You never know whether it will be windy and solar energy is mostly produced during midday while the highest consumption is in the evening. This leads us to the key component for renewables which is energy storage. \nBattery costs have been constantly declining over the past years and are becoming more and more attractive for investors and renewable project. \n\nNews from Electrek shows that Audi promises batteries at a cost as low as $114 per kWh which would really be a game changer for electrical vehicles and energy storage. The lower costs might increase demand for storage as it becomes profitable.\nThe issue with renewable energy\nOne issue with renewable energy is that you can’t store it which means that you might even have to sell it at a negative price. \nThe problem with the abundance of renewable energy in peak production times can only be solved with storage which would give a boost both to the battery and solar industry. So, the demand is here, the technology is approaching profitability or will soon reach such a target and the question remains how to invest?\n\n\nHow to invest in the trend?\nThere are three main trends to follow: \nutilities, \ncommercial buildings,\nand homeowners.\nThe steps to take for investing are the following:\nLook at the metal used in the batteries (lithium, cobalt, nickel etc.)\nLook at the metal used in creating the infrastructure (copper)\nLook at what produces the energy (wind turbines and solar panels)\nLook at the producers of all the other components\nLook at the return on investment (the most notorious might not be the best)\nLook at the political support and interest rates",

We’ll first discuss the trends in the solar industry and then how to invest in the sector as the sector is much more than just the solar panels you see around. Digging into each component of the process of transforming solar energy, storing it and powering the device you are using to read this is the key to find the best risk reward sector investments. It is interesting to expose each portfolio to the potential the solar industry offers in not only disrupting the energy environment but actually displacing it. \nThe solar industry overview and outlook\nThe renewable sector has been constantly growing over the last 10 years and solar made 50% of the sector in 2017.\n\nThe levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) has fallen by 77% for solar in the last 10 years and 38% for wind while it only declined marginally for fossil fuels. Further, lithium ion battery costs have declined 79% since 2010. Bloomberg New Energy states that the fossil fuel power “is facing an unprecedented challenge in all three roles it performs in the energy mix – the supply of ‘bulk generation,’ the supply of 'dispatchable generation,' and the provision of ‘flexibility.’” As all those costs related to renewables, from generation through solar and wind to storage with batteries are continuing to decline, sooner rather than later there could come to a shift in the way we create and consume energy that will not only disrupt the current system but even displace it. Each portfolio should be exposed to such a possibility with the best low risk high reward investment where you are rewarded extremely well if things do explode but you don’t lose much or don’t lose at all if things don’t explode.\nMarket overview\n“Solar investment globally amounted to $160.8 billion in 2017, up 18% on the previous year despite these cost reductions. Just over half of that world total, or $86.5 billion, was spent in China. This was 58% higher than in 2016, with an estimated 53GW of PV capacity installed – up from 30GW in 2016.” SOURCE: BNEF\nThese numbers are huge given the constantly declining costs which can be seen in the divergence between the actual spent amount and the capacity installed. What is important is that the solar trend is growing and the lower cost will keep it attractive despite regulatory and subsidy headwinds. Higher oil prices also help.",

However, there are challenges in ramping up and series 6 2018 is expected to be at the lower end of guidance.\n8.3 GW bookings as of last quarter (distributed to 2020 and beyond)\nTotal cumulative production for FSLR will be 15GW over 2018, 2019 and 2020 where the company as of the last conference call in April 2018 had 11.8GW practically sold they still need to book 3.2GW over the next two and a half years. The management is confident this could be easily done.\nFixed OPEX to drive margin expansion and EPS\nFurther, series 6 is already 40% cheaper than series 4 and further improvements are expected in efficiency and cost. OPEX is expected to be down to $0.05 per watt in 2020. \nWhat do we know?\nWe know that FSLR will probably deliver and sell what it has planned in the next 3 years which should lead to earnings per share of $1.75, $3 and $5 in the next three years respectively. In 2020 we could see much lower costs thanks to scale while the fixed prices booked in 2018 and 2019 would give FSLR improving margins and at least $5 billion in revenue. This could result in net earnings between $500 and $700 million that translates in $5 or $7 EPS. There is a high probability that FSLR achieves these levels in the next 3 years, the key is what we and the market don’t know.\nWhat we don’t know?\nWhat all would like to know is what will happen after 2020, how will margins perform and what will be the general demand for solar panels. However, we can try and estimate to see what might happen. We have to look at the technology FSLR uses, what is expected in the future, demand and issues that might arise with solar in this specific case. FSLR is investing significant money to be ready and reap a nice return if things stay as they are but the industry is extremely cyclical and there are no moats. \nTechnology\nFSLR uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells which is different from the crystalline silicon used commonly. Crystalline silicon PV costs more to make but is a bit more efficient. \nCyclicality\nThe solar industry is notorious for its cyclicality. For example, if there is a new improved technology coming up, many will not make deals in order to wait for the improvements which could lower plant utilization with those that have older systems. \nThe constant improvement in technology further forces manufacturers to constantly invest in new technologies and new, improved manufacturing plans.\nThe cost of solar panels is constantly declining and consequently margins depend on efficiency improvements. Solar panels are now priced at just 20% of their 2012 cost. \nAnother interesting thing to see is that FSLR is ramping up a manufacturing plant of 1GW in about a year which means others can do that too. \nPlus, there is something very interesting with solar. As there is not that much energy demand when solar produces the most energy, energy prices drop significantly during the strongest renewable production which isn’t a positive for solar farms. The thing that could really give a push to solar is storage but we are still far form that so we have to expect volatility in the sector. \nEarnings model\nI do not estimate linearity with FSLR but a maximum EPS of $7 in 2021 that declines to $3 over the long term as margins compress and others take part of the profits which is something normal in the industry. \nEarnings model based on optimistic expectations\n\nSource: Author’s estimations",

As risk is a function of price in relation to earnings higher valuations increase the risk and also the high liquidity environment makes it tough to separate between good low risk sustainable businesses and unsustainable business that will be in trouble once the environment changes. \nTherefore, a normal market portfolio is not the smartest thing to do now especially in light of the higher interest rate environment. \nHowever, here and there cheap sectors arise that offer great investing opportunities. My favorites in 2017 were emerging markets, zinc and copper. As all of them exploded it is time to find new cheap sectors and opportunities might quickly arise in the volatile emerging markets.\nIf you follow specific emerging and frontier market you will find some bargains but you must really know what you are doing there and accurately analyze your portfolio exposure due to the inherent volatility.\nWhat we don’t know\nWhat we don’t know is for how long will interest rates rise? Whether there will be a market crash, higher inflation and more monetary easing? What will crash heavily and what will be considered a safe haven? Further, geopolitical risk is always present and the volatility in various markets is high from time to time. \nWhat do? A special situation, broadly diversified all-weather portfolio – dollar cost averaging\nIn line with the above within a high risk, high uncertainty environment my idea is, and also the direction of my model portfolio, to get to about 15 to 20 positions that will make between 40% and 60% of portfolio with the remainder in cash to take advantage of the opportunities that are constantly arising. Make that cash work for you if you can as short term Treasuries yield 2% already and some brokers offer 1.3% on U.S. dollar amounts. This will allow the portfolio to be uncorrelated to market risks and reach its returns from rewards coming in various ways.\nThe diversification will come from:\nUnderpriced good businesses (developed and emerging markets – return on capital)\nEmerging markets – population growth trend and development\nHedges – gold, real assets, commodities\nUnder pressure sectors or countries\nSecular growth trends and technological developments\nMargin of safety \nSo, practically the whole exercise consists of digging in the dirt and finding long term value and growth where others are temporarily panicking or fining value where the market is underpricing future growth. We live in a fast changing world and we must look at the fast evolving trends to see whether there is the potential to find value in growth and invest.\nValue and growth means that most holdings will be volatile but that will be taken advantage of by constant rebalancing that should add some alfa in the long term in addition to the dollar cost averaging benefit. \nSo, my job is to continue to dig into sectors and find companies that have the potential to deliver 10% business returns over time and also the potential to overdeliver as we live in a winner takes it all world. \nA key component of the higher end portfolio exposure is dollar cost averaging which is in my case at 100% per year for now. Those who cannot add that much in their portfolios should enjoy the returns achieved in the last 10, 20 or even 30 years and see whether the current potential reward is worth the risk. Perhaps the best thing to do is to be extremely defensive with the largest part of the portfolio and extremely aggressive with a small part of a portfolio.",

Dividends are something that we can feel gives us a reward at least once a year and are a much more sure thing than many other possible investment returns. However, lately it hasn’t been a great time for many dividend investors as yes, dividend yields have been going up, but asset prices have also been going down, especially with many of the beloved dividend stocks. \nToday we discuss what is going on and how to approach such a situation if you are a dividend investor. Let’s start with an overview, take a look at the most probable scenario and conclude by putting the current dividend investment scenario in a historical perspective. \n\nDividend investing overview\n\nNow, I am a firm believer the market is irrational which means that more often than not, it offers investors great butter risk reward opportunities than what the market average is. However, the case with dividend stocks is a bit different. \nLet’s discuss the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) that has Exxon (XOM), AT & T (T), Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX) and J&J (JNJ) at top position with a weight of 34%. The fund is well diversified, a bit overweigh energy but that is exactly where the largest dividends are.\nThe management fee is practically nothing at 0.08% and the dividend yield is 3.62% which is much higher than the S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.84%. \nNow the performance of the DHV ETF has been nothing short of stellar since inception and $50 investing in 2011 would now be $85 not counting the yield over time.\nA dividend of 3.8% is great but if you lose another 10% in the next 6 months you need 3 years for the dividend to cover the loss. So, if the FED continues to rise rates, the yield on the safe haven Treasuries will also increase and consequently investors will require a higher yield from dividend investments. If the required dividend yield goes to 5%, you can expect the HDV ETF to decline to a price of $61.2 if the current dividend holds. A decline of $24 implies 8-years of dividends which is a lot to risk for a premium of just 55 basis points (0.55 of a percentage point) above the 10-year Treasury.",

Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nCheck the comparative stock list table on my Stock market research platform under curriculum preview!\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore about me and some written reports at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nStock market for modern value investors Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/modernvalueinvesting/\n\nHow much should you have saved by 35?\n\nAs Megan Markle just became the new Duchess of Sussex at 36, how much you should have saved before 35 became a viral thing and I have seen articles about it everywhere, from Morningstar to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe common finance standpoint is that you should have saved at least twice your yearly salary by 35 which is an achievement many compare to marrying a British prince.\n\nThe 2X salary by 35 savings rule\n\nThe fact that you should have at least 2 times your yearly salary saved by 35 comes from Fidelity and is their savings factor that gives you confirmation that you are on a good track to reach 10 times your salary by 67 and retire comfortably.\n\nFidelity came up with four factors to help you prepare for your retirement: a yearly savings rate, a savings factor, an income replacement rate and a potentially sustainable withdrawal rate. Today we will focus on the savings factor and leave the other topics for another day. I’ll try to put the savings factor into current financial market’s perspective.\n\nLet’s start with Fidelity’s assumptions which is something you might already see as crazy given the student debt you have if you are younger or the extremely high living costs today. Fidelity expects each of us to save 15% of our salary, invest more than 50% of that in stocks, retire at 67 and plan to keep your previous lifestyle. Those sound like shitty assumptions to me but let’s continue.\n\nA few issues and where you should take responsibility for your financial life and retirement\n\nGiven the above assumptions many think that if they do that, invest in index funds, overweight stocks in the first years and adding more bonds later, they will reach 10X salary savings at 67 and retire comfortably. That is actually more than correct but here are some things that are not so nice.\n\nHaving the goal to retire at 67 really sucks\n\nRetiring is something you wish to do as soon as possible or never if you love what you do. If you don’t love what you do, then better retire as soon as possible. A very inspiring story comes from 94-year-old John Goodenough, professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin and co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery. Yes, you red that correctly, 94 years of age and still a professor leading at team of scientists. \n\nFigure 3 94 and still hustling\n\nSource: UTexas\n\nSo, that is one but if not an option for you let’s look at whether what most expect can easily happen.\n\nSaving 15% of salary, 1.5% wage growth and investing should lead to 10 times salary by 67 starting at 25.\n\nI will use $40k as a starting salary because it is the average wage between 25 and 34 years old in the U.S. The ratio is what matters here not the salary.\n\nSo, if you have a salary of $40k, saving 15% of it means putting aside $6 thousand. The fact is that the average personal saving rate is 3%. The top 1% probably save around 30%, the top 1% to 10% save around 15% while the bottom 90% in income save much less.\n\n\nSo, if you are average, try to increase your savings by 5 times!\n\nReturn on investment is not even that important\n\nIf I invest 15% of my $40k salary every year for 42 years and get a 7% return, the total sum at year 42 is $1.8 million which is 22.5 times the $80k salary at age 67. However, if the return is just 5% per year, compounded, the saved amount falls to $1 million while if the return falls to 4% per year, the amount falls to $829k which is still not bad but a big difference.",

Up till 2017 the company was doing well but as Wall Street expects everlasting growth management often does complex things to satisfy the expectations and push stock prices up. \nIn December 2015 the company announced a $13 billion acquisition of Jarden that owns various brands of which one is Coleman outdoor gear. When such an acquisition is made the management counts on synergy and savings. The goal was to unlock $500 million in cost efficiencies and saving, expand the company’s global reach and be immediately accretive to earnings.",

Copper say? Investing and politics\n\n\nDespite rising inflation copper prices have been declining. \n\nHigher interest rates are putting pressure on emerging markets and their $19 trillion of debt.\n\nHowever, the best investing opportunities usually arise when things are not good.\n\n\n\nI was really bullish on copper when it was around $2 per pound a year ago but now I am not that bullish anymore as it is above $3. \nNow, in the long term I am still bullish as the metal is the key for the electric century we are entering as we slowly leave fossil fuels behind but something we must keep in mind related to portfolio exposure and copper related investments is that copper can be extremely volatile which makes copper miners even more volatile. \n\nCopper is usually named dr.Copper due to its predictive capacities in forecasting economic growth and inflation. As copper has lots of applications a rising global economy will increase the demand and the price of it due to the fact that supply is inelastic over the short term. On the contrary, a slowdown in economic demand will quickly negatively affect its price.\nNow, if we retake a look at figure 1, copper prices didn’t really go up in 2018 despite inflation being higher and the global economy supposedly doing fine. It is not down much for the year, just 6% but if the negative trend strengthens it might be an indicator of a general economic slowdown.\nOne of the main reasons for such a slowdown are higher interest rates that have already started to put pressure on some parts of the world. As always, the pressure will be first felt in emerging and frontier markets due to their speculative nature as investors rush into them when things look fine but are fast in selling at the first sign of trouble. As those financial markets are shallow, any kind of instability or interest rate increases is immediately felt.\n\nIs the $19 trillion in debt an issue for emerging markets?\n\nIn the last 10 years, emerging markets have really taken advantage of low interest rates and abundant liquidity and their total debt increased from just $5 trillion to $19 trillion. Investors in developed countries were desperate for any kind of yield due to zero or negative interest rates while emerging markets were happy to borrow due to positive economic expectations. \n\nThe problem lies mostly in sentiment as always. If interest rates increase fast, investors that have rushed into those markets will get scared of the short term negative trend, pull their money which could make it hard for companies and governments to refinance their debt. \nCapital outflows further put pressure on exchange rates, lower the value of financial assets and an emerging or frontier market could quickly see its luck change. \n\nThe point is that this puts pressure on global economic growth, demand for products and services and sooner or later this is felt first on financial markets and consequently also on other global economies. \nApart from all of the above there is also politics that play a role. \n\nPolitics\n\nAccording to the WSJ, president Trump is putting pressure on Europe to drop the support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that is supposed to bring cheap gas from Russia into Europe. The point is that Russian gas through a pipeline is cheaper that U.S. gas that has to be liquified in order to be shipped to Europe. \nAccording to U.S. and European officials the WSJ journal reports how in order to prevent an Atlantic trade was Trump is putting pressure on Germany to cut its support for the project. This has several implications for us investors.\nThe first is that when politics get involved you cannot make decisions based on natural economic forces as things get distorted.\nThe second thing is that economic forces usually prevail in the long term as the value of natural resources as gas is, sooner or later comes out. So, in the Gazprom case, watch what is going on and take advantage of the volatility. If some things are certain, Gazprom has value but for sure the stock price will remain volatile.",

Just a year ago according to WSJ, many investors like Morgan Stanley, T. Rowe Price and Ashmore group rushed to buy Argentinian stocks as the situation in the country has been improving under the new president Macri. Their position exposure has been at least 17% of their frontier market portfolios which is the Argentinian weight in the MSCI Frontier market index.\niShares even launched an Argentinian ETF and all seemed good until interest rates in the U.S. increased which made people think more about the risks and not that attracted to the quick, high interest rate gains in Argentina.\nThe stock market was doing good and even growing faster than what the currency depreciation was.\nHowever, with increased volatility on financial markets since the beginning of 2018, the situation changed and the trend inverted creating a situation where stocks go down and while the peso continues to depreciate.\nThere are a few things to think about when looking at such situations:\n\n\nThe impact of past speculation\nThe value of real assets\nUnderstand the exposure\nLook for great businesses\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of past speculation\n\nIn the last few years inflation in Argentina reached even 40% at the begin of 2016 and has been constantly above 20% since. However, the Argentinian government kept issuing notes in pesos with yields significantly above the inflation rate and the peso depreciation which attracted a lot of speculators. What is it with people and charts that show price increases will always beat me?\n\nNevertheless, the situation changed and usually when that happens panic creeps in and people try to get out as fast as possible. Mercadolibre (NYSE: MELI), which is the largest position of the MSCI Argentinian index dropped 25% which just shows how prescient Benjamin Graham was when he said that we should expect all our holdings to increase at least 50% from their lows and drop 33% from their highs in a 5 year period.",

            "description": "What do I do? Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nCheck the comparative stock list table on my Stock market research platform under curriculum preview!\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore about me and some written reports at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nStock market for modern value investors Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/modernvalueinvesting/\n\nLink to research platform:\n\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/\n\nWarren Buffett stated that all you need to know for profitable long term investing is Chapter 8 and Chapter 20 of Benjamin Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor. The Chapter is titled “The Investor and Market Fluctuations” which is something we are all always following and intrigued by. The key is to prepare both financially and psychologically for market fluctuations.\nMarket fluctuations as a guide to investment decisions – timing vs. pricing\nGraham distinguishes two ways of taking advantage of market fluctuations; you can time the market or you can price. Timing assumes you predict where will the stock market go next while pricing makes you look for stocks trading below their fair value. \nGraham is straightforward about market timing and sees it as absurd to think that the general public can ever make money out of market forecasts and technical analysis as the popularity of a market strategy cancels its benefits and long term advantage if there is any.\nCan you buy low and sell high?\nWe are all attracted by market cycles. Looking at past stock charts makes you with you sold out in 2007 and bought more in 2009 but it all looks easy only in hindsight. If we look at the S&P 500 in the last 10 years one would had been extremely happy if sold in 2011 especially as the market dropped again soon after and the stock market doubled from the 2009 bottom. However, since 2011 stocks have doubled again and this shows how difficult it is to buy low and sell high. \nSo, Graham is against making any investment decision by looking at price movements. The only thing one can do is to be prepared for stocks to fluctuate. Graham states how probably most of our holdings will advance 50% or more from their low point and decline 33% or more from the high point in the next 5 years.\nSuch huge medium term jumps make at least one thing easy; daily, weekly or even monthly stock price moves won’t make you any richer or poorer. Further, everyone of us needs significant will not to follow the crowd which is something extremely difficult to do in this market when the S&P 500 is again approaching record highs. If you must do something, Graham suggest rebalancing between bonds and stocks depending on valuation to at least partially counter the crowd.\nBusiness Valuation versus Stock Market Valuation\nThe key to making investing easy it to look at yourself as a silent partner in a private business. In such a case, your returns are completely dependent on the profits of the enterprise where the change in book value and dividends tell you your returns. \nI must say that from a personal perspective all of my past investment successes came when I focused on the business and the underlying earnings. This makes investing so easy as you don’t care much about what is going on with the stock. \nHowever, given all the entertainment surrounding investing, it is much more difficult to focus on the business than on the price. \nGraham discusses how the more a business is doing good, the more risky it becomes as the market is willing to pay whatever premium when things go well.\nGraham’s rules for investing are the following:\nBuy at maximum of 33% over book value\nBuy at a satisfactory ratio of earnings to price\nBuy into a financially strong company (low debt)\nExpect earnings to be maintained over the years\n\nConclusion – acquire businesses at suitable prices\nGraham’s message is simple:\nTake advantage of low price levels and high price levels\nBuy when you have money but be careful what you buy\nDon’t worry about market fluctuations as you can’t influence those\nAvoid buying when market has extremely high valuations, look for special situations then\nNever buy or sell something due to market moves\nFind good management running the business\nBe a business owner\nIf you can follow the above, you have nothing to worry!",

The funny thing with these flip loans is that lender estimates the borrower’s risk by their past flipping success not even acknowledging the influence of the market and rising home prices. Falling home prices? Come on, the last time that happened was centuries ago… (2012 but allow for some irony).\nSo, we have home prices rising, the flipping business is attracting more and more money and all expect home prices to continue to rise. Let’s take an objective look at the matter across the U.S. and Europe to see what are the housing market risks. This will also help you make the decision whether you should wait with buying or jump into this hot market if you are a first time buyer or if you own real-estate whether you should sell.\nWhy are house prices going up fast again?",

            "title": "STOCK MARKET RESEARCH PLATFORM BY SVEN CARLIN",
            "description": "Link to research platform:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/\n\n“The key to investment success is research and common business sense”\nI firmly believe, as it has worked extremely well for me over the past 16 years, that with proper research and a common sense investment approach a do it yourself investor can find the best investments fitting one’s personal risk reward preferences.  \nHowever, we don’t all have the time to devote ourselves full time to stock market research, to gather the necessary experience to understand what is going on in the markets and to properly estimate the intrinsic value of a company in order to buy with limited risk. Therefore, I decided to share all of what I do on this research platform where you get:\n- A monthly in-depth sector analysis to find the best stocks with tailwinds to invest in (touch on related stocks in the sector to find the best picks to cover). Given the fast-changing world we live in we have to take advantage of how the world is changing around us. \n- From each in depth sector analysis I will cover and follow at least one stock where the goal is, over time, to cover 30 stocks in depth and keep about 30 stocks on a watch list. Each month I’ll see which one has to be excluded or added. \n- A full analysis report with risk reward overview and intrinsic value estimation will be provided when coverage is initiated.  \n- Consequently, all the models will be adjusted through news and earnings.\n- A comparative table containing all the covered names and their intrinsic values that allows for better decision making. \n- A one million 20-year target portfolio with monthly investments of $1k and a $10k start where I put my money where my mouth is. The target is to reach a 12% yearly return over the next 20 years (the portfolio will be patiently built over 2018 from the researched sectors and special pics)\n- Those who want to learn more about investing can also learn from my analyses and see this as an education insight into professional investing.\n\nI hope that by sharing all my in-depth research I can add the most value to you and allow you to make better informed investment decisions. \n\nMy vision is that by making common sense investment decisions every person can find the best investments that will lead to the realization of their investing goals. As banks, investment funds and many other institutional players don’t always have their clients interest in focus the best thing one can do is to invest for oneself and avoid the hefty fees and promoted investment vehicles that make others rich. However, to do that it is key to make your decisions based on good information and a precise knowledge of your investing goals and investment behavioral attitude. \n\nThe one million portfolio is one where I start with $10k and I will be adding $1k to it on a monthly basis for the next 20 years. With an average 12% yearly return the ending sum should be $1,007,673.99. I’ll be doing it in euros as it is my currency but the numbers should be the same.\nThe point of this portfolio exercise is to think in an average investment horizon which should be 20-years and to show how I go about long term investing using dollar cost averaging, rebalancing, portfolio exposure and portfolio building, portfolio risk reward and other investment strategies. \nTo better show what I mean with portfolio rebalancing and risk exposure I’ll immediately publish what are the investments I’ve done. Important to note that I expect it to take at least a year to properly build a 20-year investment portfolio with long term diversification in place based on the research I perform. \nPricing\nI’ve been thinking a lot about how to price all of this and what I have found around is that a normal 6-page monthly newsletter is usually priced from $250 per year. \nThe portfolio tracking service is something that is also priced in line with the above. The research on sectors is usually priced in thousands per report while stock analyses and coverage is also something where the reports sell for hundreds of dollars. So, you will be getting the following value per year:\n- $250 - Monthly newsletter – market commentary and discussion\n- $250 – Model portfolio – million-dollar goal portfolio\n- $24,000 – Sector research – 12 sectors research reports\n- $6,000 – Stock analyses – at least 12 stock analyses\n- $1,000 – Continuous stock coverage and updates\n- Sven Carlin full time research work and analysis – 6 figure salary\nFor the price of $249 per year. \nAs always, I want to provide a service that is a bargain, provides immediate value and has a margin of safety. My goal is that this research platform becomes a partner you can’t invest without for the long term and therefore the price must be low so that it is not a burden on your investment returns.\nYou are practically getting all my work for 68.4 cents a day. I consider it a bargain because I will do my best to overdeliver.",

Economic collapse ahead? Stock market crash or not?\n\nA quick investment perspective on economic news will give us insight into what to do with our portfolio, what is the best risk reward portfolio allocation at this point in time and what can one expect to happen. I’ll look at U.S. economic data, emerging market yields and touch on Italy that is becoming a bigger and bigger risk.\nEconomic data – strong but also weak\nThe headline consumer price index came in at 2.5% which is good but might lead to higher interest rates which is a dance that has to stop at some point. \nHigher oil prices lead the impact on prices but those take time to really affect the economy which is something that could happen over the next year or two if oil prices persistently remain above $70. \nHowever, the market expected even higher inflation which then sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. Perhaps lower inflation is a sign of an economy slowing down. Wish it or not higher interest heavily impact sales of goods like new vehicles where a lot of debt is used and we see already that new vehicle prices have been declining. This means that automotive companies are lowering prices in order to get rid of the inventory.\nCredit card debt has stopped climbing and for the first time in 5 years we see it slightly decline due to higher interest rates.\nHigher interest rates will also impact companies and their profits. Few think about the refinancing companies to do in the next few years and what will be the impact on earnings.\nThis pile of debt is fine a long as the economy is expanding and there is confidence but we all know the pile of risk this is creating as there will be a rush to liquidity at some point. The thing to keep in mind is that the risks are piling.\nFortunately, all other metrics are still strong and unemployment indicators are extremely strong with the unemployment rate down to 3.9%.\nHowever, the yield curve is getting flatter and flatter which is a signal that the party might be coming to an end as it is impossible to constantly grow because it simply isn’t natural.",

It is a thinly traded stock with not much institutional ownership and therefore up to the mercy of retail investors and a few smaller hedge funds.\n\nAs the management didn't communicate anything for about 5 months it is easy for investors to panic especially when the stock starts drifting lower. After the last earnings report in November I explained how the risks have increased as my previously estimated catalysts for the company didn't materialize and the radio silence from the management certainly didn't aid the stock. Nevertheless, probably in response to the bleeding stock price the management surprisingly issued a quarterly report which is something they haven't done for about two years that came as a rescue to the stock price.\n\nPlease enjoy the video where I discuss the released earnings report and analyse the risk reward for the stock.",

Perhaps an ever growing long term dividend from walmart.\n\nWMT’s online business is now where Amazon’s was 10 years ago.\n\n\nWalmart recently announced that it will pay $16 billion for a 77% stake in Flipkart, the online Indian retailer.

So, on the $4.6 billion in revenue, growing fast, WMT expect to lose at least $1 and $2 billion per year respectively. This is a significant part of their $10 billion expected net income and therefore investors weren’t happy about the acquisition with the stock down 3% on Wednesday when the deal was announced.",

That is a nice way to sell the stock market to people but I really disagree with Buffett and on what he is selling. Here are my points:\n\nNobody has a 75 year investment horizon\n\nBuffett’s goal in life was just to accumulate capital and be the best investor in the world, he achieved it but I am sure that isn’t the goal of 99.9% of us. We want our money to work for us so that we can spend the extra money and have a better life or retirement thanks to our investments, 70 years is a bit too much. Therefore, we have to see what are the best risk reward investments for a 20 or even shorter investment horizon. But let’s see how Buffett’s advice to invest in the S&P 500, something he never did, holds over shorter periods of time?\n\n2) Shorter term investing - shorter than 75 years\n\nLet’s look at the distribution of 10 years returns over the last 139 years of S&P 500 available data.",

Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nCheck the comparative stock list table on my Stock market research platform under curriculum preview!\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore about me and some written reports at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nStock market for modern value investors Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/modernvalueinvesting/\n\nToday I want do describe my investing style and how it works which will give you insights in how I reach satisfying investment returns with a margin of safety. I will use Nevsun Resources (NYSE: NSU) as an example as it has been one of my largest portfolio positions over the year. \nCompany overview\nNevsun Resources is a Canadian mining company with a copper zinc mine in Eritrea and a copper gold project in Serbia. I was bullish on both zinc and copper which made Nevsun a perfect sector play. Further, Nevsun has not debt and had a cash balance of above $400 million that fell to around $150 million after it acquired Reservoir and the Timok project in Serbia. \nThe cash balance, no debt, cash flow positive mine in Eritrea and extremely high ore body grades in Serbia gave the company a margin of safety as sooner or later that value had to emerge. However, there has been plenty of bad news and this shows how we have to take advantage of Wall Street’s short term orientation and myopic view. This is what happened:\n2015 and in January of 2016 the company was hit by lower commodity prices which is exactly when my interest for NSU increased as the stock price fell from above $4 to $2.20.\nThen in 2016 Nevsun didn’t manage to smoothly shift from mining the secondary copper rich ore to mining the primary zinc rich ore. Zinc and copper recoveries were much lower than expected and the company slashed its dividend to have better funding options for the Timok project but that really hurt the stock price and problems in Eritrea led to it trading close to $2 up to the first months of 2018.\nThere was also a delay in releasing the pre-feasibility study for Timok and the company shortened the expected life of its Eritrean mine from 8 to 4 years alongside a hefty impairment.",

Woodstock for capitalists\n\nlink to Modern Value Investing book:\nKINDLE: https://amzn.to/2r184En\nPAPERBACK: https://amzn.to/2Kd55kN\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting – 15 points – Part 1\nThis Saturday the Woodstock for capitalists was on as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger held the annual shareholder conference. If you want to succeed in investing and reach your financial goals, this conference and insights is all you need to listen to in order to learn about investing, what is going on and what to do about it. In this article, I’ll summarize what are the key points to take out and also save you the 6-hour watch.\nAccounting changes\nSince this year, companies that own stocks have to mark them to market on a daily basis and include the changes in their bottom line. This has make BRK report a loss but as you can see below, operating earnings are positive. \n\nSo, don’t worry about the bottom line, look at what the business has done.\nIndexes change – survivals win\nBuffett talks about his first stock purchase but what I want to focus is the slide he used showing various indexes. \n\nBuffett discusses the DOW Jones index that survived since then but nobody knows how did the railroad index do, the utilities or the 65 stocks index over the last 75 years. Survivalship bias is one of the biggest dangers affecting investors because you see only what survives but not what dies with investing. We now have the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and MSCI global and other 6,000 indexes. Be careful as not every index will bring to equal results. \nInvest when things are not good – discussion on gold\nBuffett discusses how it was to invest during the war and how if you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 in 1942 that by the way didn’t exist then so you couldn’t not do that. Nevertheless, if you invested the $10,000 in the not existing S&P 500 you would now have $51 million. I’ve discussed last week how nobody has such an investment horizon so there is another thing to keep in mind when listening to Buffett.\nIf you bought gold at the same point in time you could buy 300 ounces of gold that didn’t produce anything. Today’s value would be around $400,000 that would be about $50 million less. I agree with Buffett and that is why I always say that gold is not an investment, it is a hedge against loose monetary policy that has to be constantly rebalanced. Further, I prefer miners that actually produce something and some even pay dividend. \nChina and U.S. – long term superpowers\nOn a trade war question with China Buffett explains how world trade is a win win situation for both countries and he believes in the benefits of free trade. Those benefits are huge and the world’s development depends on it so that he sees it as thing that will last where no one will do foolish things. \nHowever, the gap between countries must not become too wide but also that a war would threaten global prosperity.",

It boasts a PE ratio of just 14.19, a dividend yield of 1.69%, it has a strong brand, and the stock hasn’t gone anywhere in the past 3 years.\n\nLet’s see whether the 3 year underperformance is due to some structural issues or if it’s a great opportunity to buy a wonderful business at a fair price, the kind of business you want to hold forever.\n\nBefore getting started, let me just mention that DIS was one of Buffett’s biggest mistakes. Buffett invested in DIS in 1966 when the company was valued at just $80 million when he knew that it cost more just to build a few themes in the park, and pre-tax profits were $21 million. He invested $5 million and sold a year later for a 20% profit. The mistake comes from the fact that the $5 million invested back than would now be worth more than $5 billion not counting the dividends over time. So, even Buffett has made the mistake of selling great brands bought on the cheap.\n\nLet’s see if DIS will do the same for current investors over the next 50 years.\n\nDisney – The Company\n\nI always like companies that have multiple separate segments because that always makes it tough to analyze for others and thus creates opportunities especially if there are segments that might explode in the future. We all know that Wall Street focuses on the next few quarters and not so much on the future and value.\n\nDisney’s segments are Media, Parks, Studio Entertainment, and Consumer Products with Interactive media. The media network makes the most revenue, but the parks are the most profitable.",

Graham discusses how sometimes second grade bonds, or what we would now call high yield or junk bonds trade at extreme discounts to their maturity value due to changes in interest rates and due to the change in the perception of risk. The junk bond yield has significantly increased over the past few months but is still far from opportunity territory as it was the case in 2016, 2011 and especially 2009.",

Shiller on the topic of finding the perfect portfolio. It is a very interesting subject so I will summarize the interview and discuss the key concepts. Before we dig deeper let me first describe a few interesting interview intros.\nShiller didn’t get the Nobel prize for nothing as he was correctly saying that stocks were in a bubble in the 1990s and that real estate was in a bubble in the 2000s. It is interesting how when testifying before the Federal Reserve Board in 1996 Shiller called the market a bubble, especially the tech part of it. He was just 4 years early and saw the market double again in those 4 years only to be proven right later but this is one of the most difficult things to understand when investing, risk reward. Shiller and his co-author Campbell told the FED how the markets were irrationally exuberant and two days later Alan Greenspan made his famous irrational exuberance speech. It is interesting how they came to the conclusion that the markets were in a bubble.",

The title is Modern Value Investing and the book is available both in a paperback version and as an e-book on Amazon. It will immensely help the beginning and intermediate investor while the experienced investor might also find something interesting that adds value to his stock market adventures. \n\nThe book is dividend in three parts: The mindset, the skillset and food for thought.\n\nThe first part titled ‘Mindset of a value investor’ discusses the main psychological characteristics one must have to be a successful value investor. Risk is defined and explained in a way to help understand the risks when making investment decisions. I add to the common value investing line by discussing behavioral finance, the theory of reflexivity and also discuss things to be careful about like the buyback shenanigans or Wall Street interests. \n\nThe core of the book are the 25 tools to use when analyzing a company that will allow you to better analyze investment opportunities, identify a margin of safety and have a great comparative view over your portfolio. The tools range from calculating intrinsic value, determining a margin of safety to assessing qualitative factors and general market risks for the company you are looking at. \n\nPart two is followed by the application of the tools on Daimler, a nice cyclical stock to show how the tools work.\n\nPart three of the book is food for thought as it goes beyond value investing, into more diversification, hedging, portfolio strategies, selling stocks, all-weather, rebalancing, long tail and even gold.\n\nI hope you enjoy the book, if you like it don’t forget to leave a nice review on Amazon as that would mean a lot for me.\n\nSincerely, \n\nSven Carlin",

Interest rates, dividends, earnings, forecasts!\n\nThe thing with the stock market is that it gives you signals way ahead but nobody wants to listen. The things I have been blabbering about over the past two years are the following:\n\nHigher interest rates will come as the FED told us!\nHigher interest rates will squeeze valuations\nHigher interest rates will slow down economic growth\nHigher interest rates will slow down earnings growth\n\n\n\nSo, let’s start by discussing the above.\nThe 10-year Treasury passes 3%\nUp till when the 10-year Treasury was below 3% nobody seemed to care except a few crazy analysts like this scribe. However, when it crossed 3%, the market suddenly looked at what has been going on for already two years almost.\nNow, sooner or later higher interest rates must affect valuations because if you invest in the 10-year Treasury you have a guaranteed 3% yearly coupon now and a guaranteed principal payment in 10 years. This means that dividend paying stocks must trade at a premium on that. And what is important to grasp is that when the required dividend yield goes form 3% to 5%, the stock price falls 40%.\n\nSo, if you have been wondering what has been going on with dividend cash cows like Altria (NYSE: MO) apart from the normal regulatory noise and declining sector trends, well its higher required yields.",

The situation isn’t much different now, stocks are considered the best investment out there while in 1982 stocks were considered risky, highly speculative and not something to own. This is typical for how humans go about stocks, don’t forget that in your life there will be at least two such market cycles. The main point is that stocks are sometimes extremely cheap and sometimes extremely expensive and the key is to properly allocate your portfolio funds in relation to the risk and reward. So, yes, stocks have and will probably deliver inflation protection and higher returns over the long term but these benefits, to quote Graham: “could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price for his shares”.\nThis was the case from 1929 when it took 25 years for stocks to regain lost territory and let’s hope it will not be another historical case from 2018 even if valuations and debt looks similar. Of course, reinvesting dividend changes things but now there isn’t much to reinvest.\nGraham had no enthusiasm for common stocks in late 1971 due to the high valuations.",

Which one to buy!\nCheck the holdings of your ETF – BIG DANGER/SCAM!\nThere are now almost more ETFs than stocks!\nMany new ETFs have a fancy name but no relation to the actual trend.\nWe discuss the new autonomous drive and electric vehicle ETF – DRIV!\n\nYesterday I came across a new ETF on autonomous drive and electric vehicles. As I am interested in the sector I decided to give it a look and what I found is shocking. I would like to take this opportunity to address an extremely important issue: given the mania surrounding ETFs as those are perhaps the most popular investment products I want to shed some light on the industry to show that not all ETFs are equal and you should really check your ETF before you invest in any of such investment vehicles. Before I dig into specific ETFs let me just give an intro on the industry.\nThe EFT industry – Wall Street will offer what sells\nThe main notion with Wall Street is that it will offer whatever the customer wants to buy or whatever is easy to sell to the customer. As inflows to ETFs have just been going up over the last few years, Wall Street has just added ETF to ETF.\n\nNow, people like ETFs because of their liquidity which makes them better than index funds but the ETFs have to thank their success to the long lasting bull market which they themselves have influenced. The key question is how will this work in a bear market? My simple answer is that there is potential disaster ahead as we have seen in February, just $30 billion of outflows lowered the market by 5% in one week. The key to understand is that the exit door is not as big as many think when they see the total global market capitalization for $90 trillion for stocks. But, not to talk about the standard ETF risks let me dig into specific ETFs that we can easily call scams and people should be aware of that. Let me start with the new ETF from Global X – DRIV. \nAutonomous drive and electric vehicle ETF – DRIV",

I have discussed some silver miners that also represent interesting investing opportunities so today I’ll first give a short update on silver and continue with my discussion on a few silver miners.\nSilver is up a bit\nIn the last month silver prices increased from $16 to the current $17 which might not seem much but it is for silver miners as every dollar increase in prices is pure pre-tax profit for them.\n\nSilver is up on higher inflation expectation, more geopolitical turmoil but we must keep in mind that silver prices are volatile and one never knows where those will go in the short term. Let’s continue to look at silver miners to see if the risk reward opportunities are better than with physical silver.\nPan American Silver Corp (NASDAQ: PAAS)\nWhat first nice about PAAS is the cash mining costs below $5 and all-in sustaining costs of $10.79 that should allow for significant cash flows and profits. There is also a 0.8% dividend yield which is not bad for a hedge.",

I’ll use a bottom up approach and today discuss Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC). By analyzing the company we will see how it fits in the lithium environment and what we have to seek for when analyzing investments as there is a high likelihood that lithium will be the place to be over the next 10 years due to its lightness. \n\nLithium Americas\n\nAt the end of November 2017 LAC reached a high of $10.95 only to steadily decline to $5 since then while it is at $5.3 as I am writing this. When something in a positive structural trend drops 50% I like to look at what is going on. \nInvesting in Lithium is a long term trend so we have to be careful how we go about it, find the best lithium stocks for our risk reward preferences and be ready to rebalance in a lithium supply glut or recession.",

Two such hot investment trends are marijuana stocks and lithium miners that we discussed yesterday. Today I’ll touch on the marijuana stocks to see whether those will end up like a fad that will burn investors or there is some actual sector earning capacity. \nThe things to look sector wise are demand and supply, production costs, potential margins and the inevitable investing trend and momentum that has been created. The sector’s revenue has to also be compared with the total market cap of the sector and we have to look at whether there are some producers that have a business moat of some kind to differentiate between investments and speculations. \nI am going to discuss the sector by analyzing the largest player on the block, Canopy Growth (TSE: WEED) but let’s first look at the sector.\nThe cannabis industry\nThe exuberance surrounding the industry started in 2017 when the legalization of cannabis is Canada became a fact and stocks surged on the news. \nHowever, since the start of this year there has been an increase in volatility and marijuana stocks haven’t go up. Let’s dig deeper to see whether it is a trend or fad that will burn out like a joint.\nCanopy expects the weed market to be from $5 to $10 billion soon",

In the last 18 years we have seen two crashes of 50% and if you live in the Netherlands you still dream of those 2000 highs. Nevertheless, a 9 year bull market quickly erases all the painful memories but forgetting what happened and how it looked might be very dangerous. If you haven’t lived through a stock market crash, you should then at least try and think about it in order to be prepared as much as you can.\n\nWe analyze the 2008 and 2009 stock market crash and describe 4 steps how you can be prepared!",

The used bond maturities are from one month to 30 years.\nWhat the yield curve is showing is practically the cost of borrowing money over time for the U.S. government in this case.\nSteepening and flattening yield curve\nThe yield curve can be flat or steep.\nA steep yield curve is usually at the beginning of an economic expansion. Investors fear future higher inflation and demand a higher return for the long term but the central bank still keeps short term rates low. Thus, the yield steepens.\nA flat yield curve shows that long term investors are willing to take an equal yield as short-term investors in order to lock in the yield for the longer term. This means they are expecting lower yields in the future. And, historically is has been the case that economic recessions follow a flat yield curve.",

No matter where you are aggressive or defensive this chapter is crucial for this environment as being defensive might be the most aggressive thing one can do. Let’s see what Graham had to say about the stock and bond allocation and whether it still applies to this environment.\nOpposite view on risk\nThe common view on risk is that low risk equals low returns but Graham, like me, sees things from a different perspective. For him a well-researched bargain is much less risky than a bond because bonds lose a lot if interest rates increase and if there is inflation, thus those are also risky.\nThe basic problem of bond stock allocation\nGraham’s view for the defensive investor is to have an allocation between bonds and stocks between 25% and 75%. When stocks are cheap one should have 75% in stocks and vice versa. This is against human nature and we have seen that in 2017, after an 8-year bull market, stock market inflows were the highest. However, this human trait of buying high is exactly the reason why one should do the opposite and buy low when others are selling low. \nAnother problem is that the stock bond allocation is personal and here is where the problems start. If you would have been just 25% in stocks for the past 3 years you would have missed out on the 25% run the S&P 500 has had since while your returns would be around zero given the returns on bonds and their recent decline.",

We are going to go trough his findings of the time and through his updated findings that he publishes for Credit Suisse in order to see what we can expect from long term investment returns. \nHistorical risks and returns\n\nThe main questions investors worry about are their returns and their risks. What we want to know is what will our return be and what is the probability that it won’t be positive over a certain period of time. A look at long term returns over 16 countries will show us what has happened and thus what can happen.\nThe first striking fact is that 99% of stock market commentary uses return from the U.S. market which is the top performing market alongside Australia and South Africa. However, the median return is 50% lower that the most famous U.S. return and real returns have been as low as 2% in some countries. \nThis tells me that such low long term returns can happen again. Let’s see what can you expect if your investment horizon is let’s say 20 years or even more.",

As many value investors know, you need to buy stocks when there is blood on the streets so I have had many questions whether this is an opportunity or a trap. Let’s take a look at what is going on, give a fundamental perspective and a stock market perspective on investing in Russia. \n\nWhat happened over the weekend\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/treasury-designates-russian-oligarchs-officials-and-entities-in-response-to\n\nOn Friday, Trump designed sanctions on 7 Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, 17 Russian government officials and a state-owned Russian weapon trading company. The reasons are, according to Treasury secretary Mnuchin that the Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe. So, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealings with them where also an non-U.S. person could face sanctions for facilitating their transactions. The companies affected are: Norilsk, Gazprom, Renova and Rusal among those traded on U.S. stock exchanges where its CEO Deripaska who is investigated for money laundering and accused of treating part in extortion and racketeering. \nAnd I thought that in the U.S. you are not guilty until proven otherwise in a courtroom.\n\nNevertheless, this is exactly the risk I have been discussing when investing in Russia. Even if the cheapest stock market today, it is so for a reason. If all holders of the ERUS ETF from the U.S. or from Europe are forced to sell their holdings because facilitating Deripaska and others with capital the price will be very low. So, investing in Russia is a political thing but as always, if you don’t have any constrains from Trump’s sanctions, it is also an opportunity. Let’s take a longer term look\nIn the 2014/2015 period the Russian ETF lost 50% on lower oil prices and sanctions. Then there was a bit of a quiet period and slowly people have been forgetting about the risks with higher commodity prices as the Russian ETF is 37% oil related. However, those who bought when there was blood on the street did well with a 50% return since January 2016. The key now is to see whether there is blood on the streets now and whether the sanctions will have an impact on the actual businesses and your ownership. The best way to look at whether there is blood on the streets is to look at fundamentals.\n\nFundamentals\n\nERUS’s PE ratio is 6, the price to book value is 0.8 and the yield is 5.7%. However let’s take a lookout what happened in the last round of sanctions!\n\nSberbank, the largest Russian bank had a PE ratio of 2 if I remember well in 2015 and was trading at below $5.",

We are going to discuss 5 steps and also discuss weather you should invest in stocks or pay of your debt. \nFor that I’ll use an actual example as I recently received a message from a young reader looking for financial life advice. This is I think unfortunately an average situation for an American college graduate and some Europeans. I will describe the situation and then apply some rational financial techniques but also behavioral ones that will allow for the creation of good long-term investing/rational habits. The habit is the key over the long term. Topics discussed are debt repayment, renting or buying, debt interest rates vs. return on investment.",

I was happy I didn’t buy as the stock dropped to below $13 by December of the same year on the first announced loss, profit warnings, broken growth story, the CEO leaving and restructuring costs. It wasn’t a great picture for MCD at the moment. Fast forward 16 years and you are looking at a 10-bagger investment with amazing dividends where the current dividend is almost 25% of the $19 price when I was watching MCD at. \n\nFortunately for me I did find some better investments at the time but still MCD was really a great investment as it had a great brand, strong customer base, addictive products which were a healthy base for the restructuring process that delivered the seen growth. A company that might be in a similar situation is Starbucks (SBUX) on which I want to focus today and I will try to estimate where will the company by in 10 and 20 years to see whether it is a good investment now or at least a stock to watch. We all know the company is still growing, the business model is proven and it might just be a great business. When you find one, the price doesn’t really matter for the long run, like it was the case for MCD at $19. SBUX is not in much better shape than MCD was in 2002.\nSBUX – how much room for growth is there still\nSBUX grew revenue at 6% in Q1 2018 and 2% comparable growth in the U.S. which is not something Wall Street is thrilled about. However, the U.S. is just half of Starbucks as almost 50% is outside of the U.S. The key to SBUX’s international growth is China.\nSBUX has 3,200 stores in China today and plans to have 5,000 by 2020. Comparable sales growth in China is 6% which shows that SBUX is gaining traction there and the trends SBUX is focusing on are the increased middle class and a western life style where coffee substitutes tea.\nThere are also 3 risks!",

Graham’s data go up to 1971 but so we will first look at his and later discuss the insight on the current situation.\n\nThe main points Graham emphasises where we can learn much from history are:\n\nthe VARYING relationship between stock prices and their earnings and dividends\nIt is important to understand the manner in which stocks have mede their underlying advance through the MANY cycles of the past century \nLook at successive TEN-year averages of earnings, dividends and stock prices\n\nGraham’s take\n\nFrom 1871 to 1971 there have been 19 bear markets where stocks fell from 15% to 86% from top to bottom. Yes, 86% is the correct number and it was even 89% of the S&P 500 in the 1929-1932 period. Many forget that the 1920s were one of the best periods in history based on consumerism etc. Rings a bell? However, that is a story for another day. Let’s look at how Graham describes what had been going on.",

If that is true, there is lots of more downside for stocks. Let’s see what the latest economic news are, how that fits the economic cycle, what is the probability for a recession and what should we expect from stocks. \nEconomic news\nThe economic news is relatively good. Jobless claims have reached the lowest level in history.\nThe unemployment rate is expected to fall even further which means more jobs and an even stronger economy.\nAnd, inflation is slowly reaching the FED’s target of 2% which shows healthy demand for good and services.\nTo sum it all up, even the FED has increased their economic growth projections. So, things haven’t been this good in the past 8 years, so why are stocks declining or why are the markets so nervous?\nWell, those who have a longer term perspective on things, by longer term I mean a cyclical perspective on things know that the economy, all economies for that matter work in cycles and after 8 years of economic growth, it is a good time for a quick consolidation and recession which is always painful, for stocks, people and especially the business environment. Let’s see where we are in the cycle. \nThe Economic Cycle\nThere are three major components of economic growth: productivity, the short term debt cycle and the long term debt cycle. Today I’ll focus on the short term debt cycle first, mention the long term too to show what can happen and we will touch on productivity some other time as the credit is the most important thing now. \nSo, an economy is driven by credit, the more credit there is the bigger is the growth as consumers spend more. So, let’s take a look at consumer credit.\n\nAt some point people will reach their credit maximum\nHigher interest rates will increase debt payments and defaults\nDemand for cars, trips, pools, houses will drop\nA recession is inevitable, the question is only when\n\nWhat does this mean for stocks?\nA short term debt cycle recession would eradicate the weeds from the stock market, readjust valuations on good business and offer plenty of buying opportunities. \nIf the long term debt cycle bursts we are in for a complete change of how things work and how things have worked over the past 75 years. Instead of constant debt growth what has been going on over the last 75 years, we would be seeing painful deleveraging, probably inflation as governments would rush to print even more money and stagflation. One chart will explain what I mean.",

However, nothing was really happening until the last two months when volatility spiked and stocks are actually below their all-time highs. \n\nVolatility has increased and the daily sharp up or down moves tell us the market is looking for direction. Now, there are two ways to look at what is going on, one is the short term way that looks for clues about what has pushed stocks down 3% on Monday while the other is the longer term perspective that has pushed Buffett to amass $116 billion in cash on Berkshires balance sheet.\n\nSo, let’s discuss the short-term view first and then the long term view.\nShort term view on the stock market\nSuddenly, since the market peaked in January, investors got jittery about what is going on amidst fears of trade wars, tech regulation and higher interest rates driving the economy into a recession. The sad thing is that their fears are well founded. \nSo, why did stocks start declining just in January and not earlier? Well, most investors don’t look at fundamentals but look at factors that will push stocks higher. We have to look at what pushed stocks higher in 2017. The answer is simple, higher earnings growth thanks to lower taxes and higher expected earnings. The market always prices in what will most likely happen so 2017 was about pricing in what will happen in 2018 so that now suddenly the market has nothing to look forward to as a catalyst to push stocks higher like it was the case in 2017.",

For those who are not familiar here is a short briefing:\nWhat is ‘Trust the Process’\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are an NBA team and in the basketball league you get players by drafting them from universities through an annual draft. The worse of a team you are, the more chances you have to get a higher draft pick in the draft lottery. \nFormer Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie decided the team should sacrifice short term wins in order to finally get a chance to win it all. In 2013 they traded their best players to get the best draft picks and rebuild a team. From there, the 76ers went from a mediocre team to a terrible, bad, bad, bad team.\nTrust the Process when investing\nIn this market especially, you can decide whether you want to follow the latest fads and hope for mediocre returns as sooner or later every bull market ends badly to quote Graham. \nWhen I worked for Bloomberg in London I used to read The Intelligent investor in the tube (UK metro) and wrote a few quotes on a piece of paper that I recently found that perfectly fit the Trust the Process investing mindset. Apart from the one stating that all bull markets end badly the others are:\nBe a critical thinker\nSimilarly to what they did in Philadelphia, sometimes what the majority does is not the best way to invest and will not lead to the best long term return.\nInvest in businesses\nThis one is one I keep repeating. Your investment returns will be perfectly correlated with the earnings returns the businesses you invested in deliver. As Philadelphia decided to sacrifice three years of winning (dividends) to find the best players you might also think about adding only the best businesses to your portfolio.\nSell to optimists and buy from pessimists",

Gold prices are up almost 10% over the last 12 months.\nThe reasons behind gold’s strength lie in President Trump’s hard line new staff like John Bolton might lead to new issues with Iran as things with North Korea might be easing. Further, despite what is hopefully just news noise as I don’t like wars something more fundamental might be driving some players to increase their positions in a safe haven like gold. \nHigher interest rates don’t only mean higher returns on Treasuries as the same higher returns increase the burned on all those in debt. Therefore, some are already positioning themselves to an economic slowdown that might get triggered by higher interest rates. \nGiven that U.S. deficits continue to get larger and higher interest certainly don’t aid, foreign investors have starter to stir a bit away from U.S. denominated debt.",

A future oil contract is one where you buy a certain amount of oil at a future date. Since Monday March 26, future contracts have started trading at the Shanghai International Energy Exchange. The Exchange is in a free trade zone which means that foreigners can trade on that market too. \n\nSome say it is the end of the Petrodollar while others say it won’t be able to compete due to the easiness the Chinese government interferes with free markets especially one where there is a lot of speculation that you never lack in oil markets and because the Yuan is a government-controlled currency. Nevertheless, we have to see this from a realistic investment perspective. The petrodollar will not disappear but if China, who is the largest global customer for oil manages to bend the market at least a bit, the dollar will definitely see increased competition from a new and rising economy and currency. Chinese companies can now buy oil without feeling the risk of fluctuations is foreign currencies.\n\nWhere is the game changer here? Well, up till now, if you wanted to buy oil you had to have U.S. dollars, thus buy the U.S. denominated IOUs. Now, if the market slowly turns to the Yuan, there will be less demand for the dollar and thus the actual value and image of the reserve currency will slowly weaken over time. \nSome have been putting fake news out that the petro-yuan will be backed by gold but I have not been able to find any official source so that is something not to take for official. \n\n What happens if the dollar loses its dominance?",

As I don’t have a crystal ball the best thing to do is to be hedged against such a situation in order to sleep well. \nSomething also very important to understand is that inflation is much more related to your personal finances than your portfolio. As we have seen in the Chapter 2 analysis of the intelligent investor, stocks don’t really offer immediate protection form inflation so we have to be protected from a personal standpoint. \n\nLife and inflation\n\nThe average inflation rate in Europe was 1.72% over the last 20 years while the average in the U.S. was a bit higher where the cumulative inflation rate was 55%. \n\nWhat is possible is that in the next 20 years we continue to have low inflation but it is also possible that we have high inflation. I don’t know what will happen but I like to be protected. \n\nAs I said inflation is about our personal finances, let’s look at who is protected and who isn’t.",

Now, there has been a lot of talk how even small caps are overvalued and a part of the stock market to definitely avoid even if it is tempting to search for opportunities where Wall Street is renowned for missing them. A Wall Street article was recently titled “How much are small caps overvalued?”. Let’s dig into the U.S. small cap environment to see what is going on. I’ll start by taking a look at the iShares Core S&P Small cap ETF (IJR) that tracks the S&P 600 small cap index.\nSmall Cap performance\n\nAs said, small caps usually outperform and their performance over the last 18 years has been nothing short of stellar. $10k invested in the ETF in 2000 would be now north of $50k not including any dividends while the S&P 500 is up ‘only’ 83%. A 500% performance leads many to believe the small cap environment is hugely overvalued.",

Believe me there is plenty of it relevant, especially in this stock market. This will allow us to compare the current market with essential value investing wisdom and perhaps improve our risk reward perspective on things. Let’s start with chapter 1; Investment versus speculation: Results to be expected by the Intelligent Investor. This chapter discusses the appropriate portfolio policy for the individual investor, an everlasting topic.\n\nChapter 1 – distinction between investor and speculator\n“An investment operation is one in which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.” \nThe key to Graham, as later with Buffett and Klarman is safety of principal which is the leading rule with value investors, never lose money.\nAs now, so in the 1970 the was a big misunderstanding of who is an investor and who a speculator. Graham wouldn’t be happy when he would hear the notion of “investing in cryptocurrencies”. Therefor, if you are an investor you invest in the business and take little risk, everything else is speculations. In this market, it means that 98% of all assets are speculations. After the next crash, the stock market will again be called a casino and all things related as speculations, even if now everything seems an investment. As long as it goes up, it is. Same things were going on towards the end of the 1940s when stocks were considered a gamble, thus cheap and in the 1960s when the entire stock buying public called themselves investors.",

I like to have some gold miners in my portfolio as a hedge against future possible crazy monetary policies. Let’s say that it helps me to sleep well over night. I’ll soon make an update on gold but before that I want to share my thoughts on silver. Many see gold and silver as equals which leads them to believe that silver is extremely undervalued and overlooked. Let’s dig into the supply and demand trends for silver and the main trends surrounding silver in general in order to see whether silver is like gold or perhaps better or worse. If there is a currency collapse, silver will most likely do well as gold.",

Or better to say, the value that is destroyed is practically stolen from us. Thought buybacks, corporate managements make a disservice to the population. I look at S&P 500 earnings and how those are higher than what is the long term value created. I also discuss how Buffett's favourite investing metric is the change in book value, i.e. the intrinsic value.",

            "description": "What do I do?

Where I think I can add value is by discussing AAPL from a long term perspective, one many fail to see, and which could be the reason Buffett has made AAPL his largest portfolio holding. \n\nIf you go through AAPL's conference call you will see how almost all of the analysts covering the stock focus on short term issues like the iPhone cycle, the capital structure etc. The consequently insert what they see has changed into their models and estimate AAPL's target price. \n\nHowever, I don't think Buffett is concerned whether the new HomePod will show stellar sales or not. He is more concerned about things like moats, return on invested capital, cash available to shareholders, the efficiency of buybacks and the capacity AAPL has to generate strong cash flows in the future. Of course, the strong current earnings and cash flows help but there is so much more to AAPL. I finish my video with an ecosystem comparison where I compare AAPL to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) which shows how undervalued AAPL actually is which may be the main reason why Buffett is buying. Enjoy the video and I am looking forward to your comments!",

I analyse the stock by discussing earnings, create a valuation model that calculates the intrinsic value and discuss the risks related to investing in Nokia.\nNokia pays a dividend and has positive cash flows.",

What the consumer price index (CPI) shows is much lower than actual inflation. This allows government to lower their costs and economic payments because those are usually indexed to inflation. Further, low inflation keeps interest rates down which allows for more government debt. \nWe discuss some inflation examples, how inflation actually affects your life, how inflation methodology is adjusted to keep it low and how you should apply a higher inflation rate in your financial planning and investment strategy. \nOn should really look at the best investments to protect and also earn from inflation.",

The current yield has gone up and if you want protection from declining yields and low inflation, you might want to look at bonds. This does not mean a financial crisis will come but a proper portfolio strategy should hold bonds and a 2.4% yield is attractive. \nNobody knows whether the FED will be able to deliver on its projected policy measures but being prepared to anything is always good. Perhaps a Treasury bond or ETF will be the best investment or stock in 2018. I discuss why a bond ETF might be a good hedge for your portfolio by analyzing macroeconomic factors affecting the American economy,",

            "description": "In this weekly news edition we discuss how the wealth of the rich is constantly growing while the average person doesn't see any improvements. This is because asset values like stocks and real estate keep going up due to low interest rates. \nSuch an environment really gives some food for thought on how will the economic scenario develop in the future. It is highly unlikely that we will see higher interest rates as the paper wealth would shrink. Therefore, lower rates are likely in the long term. 10- year Treasury yields show how distorted this environment is and how it will continue to be so for peace to be kept. Even if the stock market is overvalued, it might continue to remain like that for a very long time.\n\nWhat do I do?

Full-time independent stock market analyst and researcher:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nCheck the comparative stock list table on my Stock market research platform under curriculum preview!\n\nI am also a book author:\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nMore about me and some written reports at the Sven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com\n\nStock market for modern value investors Facebook Group:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/modernvalueinvesting/\n\nThe predominant investment strategy is to invest in index funds which means that you own an index like the S&P 500, which is a basket of the 500 biggest businesses traded in the U.S. Owning part of the 500 best businesses in the U.S. is not a bad thing but there are a few things you should know before allocating your hard-earned money to index funds. \n1) Investing in index funds is extremely risky\nYou probably read that many, even Warren Buffett says that investing in index funds is the best way to invest. However, there are many catches that go along that statement. \nThe first thing many forget to talk about is the risk of investing in index funds. The S&P 500 has dropped 49% in 2001 and 57% in 2009. Such huge drops are extremely indicative of what can happen. And, it will certainly happen again sometimes in the future. \n\nIn both cases the S&P 500 recovered but there is absolutely no guarantee that it will do so after the next drop. For example, after the 1920s bull market, it took the S&P 500 25 years to return to the previous level.\n\nThere are also many periods of more than 10 years where stock market returns haven’t really been positive. From 2000 to 2013, from 1968 to 1982, just to give a few examples. If we adjust the returns for inflation, the periods where the actual return is zero are even longer; 2000 to 2016, 1966 to 1994 and what is also staggering is that from 1927 to 1982, inflation adjusted stock market returns have been negative.\n\nThere is only one way to properly invest in index funds and it is a good strategy if you can stick to it for your whole life. Only if you dollar cost average your investments into index funds, you will do fine over the very long term. Dollar cost averaging means that you invest a fixed amount every month no matter what is going on in the market. This way you invest when things go well but also when things don’t go that well, which is the key. If you look back to the above chart, those who invested in 1931, 1940, 1982, 2009 have reaped the best investing returns. As it is impossible to time the market, dollar cost averaging is the only way to properly invest in index funds. However, few have the discipline to do so over the long term.\nA dollar cost averaging strategy works only if you keep investing through thin. This means that it is essential to invest when there is blood in the streets. Blood in the streets means that most others are selling in panic of what might happen next and nobody wants any kind of relation with stocks. A similar situation happened in 2001 and 2009. Those who have been constantly investing in stocks during the last 10 or 20 years, month after month, did well. However, if you stop investing during a recession because you prefer to safe a bit of cash in case you get fired, then index investing should be completely avoided because extremely risky and will lead to bad returns. As simple as a dollar cost averaging strategy might solve the issue.\nWhere did the 5.4% yearly difference go? Well, it was eaten up by fees and by the fact that most invest in stocks at the wrong time and usually sell at the wrong time too. Most investors buy high and sell low.\nTherefore, it is extremely important to understand that investing in index funds works only if you stick to such an investment strategy for 40 years and add money constantly, month per month and reinvest the dividends without exception. The sad part is that, very few manage to apply such a strategy through life and that is something you should really see whether you can do. If you can’t invest when the stock market is down, or even worse, have to pull your funds out of the stock market when there is a crash, index investing certainly isn’t for you.\n2) Dividends are extremely low\nAs shown in figure 3, inflation adjusted stock market returns aren’t that stellar. Over the last 90 years those have been just shy of 2% per year. The biggest benefit from investing in the stock market in the last 90 years has come from dividends. The problem is that those dividends are at historical lows now.",

Investing for retirement is tricky because it takes a lot of time and a lot can happen over 45 years in the stock market and with stocks. However, Yale professors Ian Ayres and Barry J. Nalebuff have shows that using sensible margin investing can lead to much higher returns over the long term as you allow time to work for you. Compounding really leads to huge differences if you start young.",

That is still my main focus when analyzing and investing in a company but I have learned that there is something no fundamental investor can disregard, market sentiment. We can clearly state that the markets are irrational but irrationality also means that it might take a long time for the market to understand its irrationality and correct itself. As Maynard Keynes would say: \n“The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”\nOr, a much heavier statement but excellent food for thought:\n“There is nothing so disastrous as a rational investment policy in an irrational world.”",

You can buy the book here:\n\nhttp://amzn.to/2isyc76\n\nIt’s a book you should definitely read, if you haven’t already, as it gives a great representation of how Wall Street works over the long term and describes many stock market bubbles, stock valuations through time, the firm foundation theory and the castle in the air theory, and it dismantles technical analysis and fundamental analysis.\n\nMalkiel is strongly in favor of diversification, index funds, proper asset allocation, risk and long term investing, but the biggest value you can get from reading his book is the common sense related to personal investing and how the risk of investing is related to your personal financial situation and financial goals, not so much the stock market if you avoid doing stupid things.",

There is a big difference in buying and holding something that gives you a 4% returns or a 15% return. This will have a huge effect on your retirement savings and investments.\nWarren Buffett, the legend of buy and hold, is not such a buy and hold guy as we might think of him. \nThe current stock market is simply too risky to use a buy and hold strategy, it won't pay in the long term as it did in the past.",

I make an investment analysis of a very interesting Chinese micro lender that has been hammered after the IPO. \nIt is a stock to watch because if the stock price goes lower, it becomes a more and more interesting stock investment because despite the headwinds it is not going to be unprofitable and it is still growing at 200%. Whether it is a stock to buy depends on your risk reward preference.\nThe confirmation of earnings growth and quality in 2018 could be the positive catalyst going into 2018.",

It is important to understand the risks of investing in stocks before investing.\nIf stocks crash it can end up pretty badly an the S&P 500 can lose 75% of its value. \nThe triggers are related to the economic situation, government debt burdens, central banks losing control, political turmoil or inflation. I will discuss in a different video how to prepare for the imminent stock market crash. The current debt burdens are creating both an economic and debt burden. \nHowever, a smart investor can prepare by investing in some hedges.",

Concepts like loss aversion, the emotional investing cycle, recency bias, probability neglect can really help you do well even if a stock market crash or stock market collapse comes in 2018.

However, by doing some due diligence, a common sense comparative analysis you can really lower your long term risks. After some time, if there is value it is usually recognized as it was the case with other Chinese stocks that I already covered like YY. Inc. (NASDAQ: YY) or Jupai (NYSE: JP). \nYY video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdT9m8yTI2Y\nJupai video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMzq2CVRvUc\n\nIn the video I discuss 4 stocks that had a recent IPO and the things to look for in order to find good long term Chinese investments. From my experience, investors are scared to invest in China and expect confirmation of a thesis before investing. This usually results in sharp upward moves when the value of a stocks gets unlocked. \n\nThe stocks discussed are a Chinese search engine, Sogou (NYSE: SOGO), a microlender, Qudian (NYSE: QD), and two logistics companies that strongly differ in profitability, Best Inc. (NYSE: BSTI) and ZTO Express (NYSE: ZTO).\n\nFor those interested, I already covered ZTO more in depth here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmIgc9G_C0o",

I discuss why it is important to become a real estate investor and how to properly approach such an investment. Investment properties can give you excellent passive income over the long term. I share five tips that I use and find essential for a proper real estate investment strategy.\nThe best thing is that you invest in real estate with little money as you use debt because that will make you rich! investment mortgages are so cheap now that it is a shame not to take advantage of the low interest rates. \n\nHere is the extremist link! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh5F642HNjo",

Nevertheless, if you look at the relations between stock markets, central bank activities, distorted interest rates and yield you quickly get to the conclusion that today everything is too big to fail.\nThe social pain of companies with high yield going default, higher interest rates on many centuries or even a decline in the stock market that would affect pension funds would be intolerable and it is my opinion that central banks will do whatever it takes to keep the situation as is, until they lose control of the financial system.",

The opportunity of buying something at a 50% discount or more is very attractive but there are also risks. A falling stock arouses the imagination of many value investors. \nI analyze GoPro (GPRO) stock to show how investors can be wrong when catching a falling knife. \nI discuss ten rules that touch on intrinsic value, behavioral finance, margin of safety and others in order to give the necessary framework to look into such an investing strategy. \nEven if Wall Street usually says to never catch a falling knife, I must say that with proper investment research one can sure make a profitable strategy out of it.",

Economist Richard Thaler just received the Nobel prize for this contribution to economics, financial education, financial market analysis and irrational decision making. I analyze Thaler's concepts: the endowment effect, anchoring, hyperbolic discounting, mental accounting, misplacing, price targets and ask you 7 questions during the video that can really help you it seeing your behavioral mistakes and perhaps avoid them. If you are not irrational, then you will see how to take advantage of the irrational behavior of others on financial markets.",

I discuss the findings from professor Edward McQuarrie that shows us charts we never saw before. Interesting how 30 year periods of negative returns have been very common in the past. Nevertheless, such dark periods have been the best for people like Buffett. Therefore we get an idea how to invest in order to reach good long term returns. Additionally, if stock market returns are good, it usually means that future returns won't be that good.",

Nevertheless, by looking at price to book value and growth you can determine whether you lose or gain from buybacks as a shareholder. The short term picture is different.\n\nHere is the link to my past article: http://www.investivdaily.com/is-your-value-being-destroyed-sven-tells-you-how-to-spot-it/",

Fortunately, it is not that difficult, all you need to do is know the business and estimate future earnings. Add a valuation to that and you have your intrinsic value. I discuss Skechers (NYSE: SKX) as an example for calculating intrinsic value and how stock values are much more volatile than intrinsic value.",

Hedging is not only about options and future contracts but there are many more options to protect your portfolio from whatever can happen in the global economy of financial environment. The stock market can always crash but it can also always double in the next few years and missing the boat might be even more painful than losing something in a crash. It is even better if you can't lose anything in a crash which is the principle of hedging. \nI discuss how to hedge against inflation, monetary policies, quantitative easing, currency risk, portfolio concentration and also discuss some unconventional hedging strategies that are extremely simple but few apply them. I also explain what is hedging.",

I fully disagree because bonds are about to be a terrible investment in the future. Remember that bonds were called certificates of confiscation back in the 1970 due to constantly rising interest rates and inflation. As interest rates are at all time lows it might happen again.\nI also discuss high yield bonds or junk bonds and the risk of investing in bond ETFs.\nWhen bond yields go up, bond prices go down, it is as simple as that. Where will yields and interest rates go from now on?",

They explain it as more risky to confirm their efficient market theory but I don't see that risk if it is so much better. Nevertheless, I think investors can do much better as not all value is good value!",

Even better than stocks should be index funds. By using the same data that leads to the above fallacy I show how stock returns are far from granted and the likelihood that the past 35 years repeat themselves is practically zero, thus the promised 10% are the biggest lie in investing. The best what we can expect from the S&P 500 in the next 3 decades is 4% per year.",

I immediately dig into the sector when I read something like that and I must say there could be some interesting stock bargains to buy or at least to watch now. I first analyze the sector, diamond supply and demand and then discuss two miners, Lucara Diamond Corp and Dominion Diamond. Both have huge potential, one is a small player that finds big gems like the 1,109 carat Lesedi la Rona while the other is developing interesting diamond mines in Canada. Both pay a nice dividend while you wait for diamond prices to surge.",

We first describe how is EV/EBITDA calculated, first enterprise value and then earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Also the pros are discussed where EV/EBITDA shows how a business is actually doing but we also discuss how it can be manipulated and why it is in the interest of Wall Street.

The one road one belt project aims to connect 70 countries and create long term economic prosperity in Asia and beyond. \nA smart investor has exposure to such a trend, the development is inevitable and much more likely than what is going on in the developed world. \nOne can invest also by exposing his portfolio to strong global brands like Starbucks.\nSven Carlin Research Platform:\nhttps://sven-carlin-research-platform.teachable.com/p/stock-market-research-platform\n\nModern Value Investing book:\nhttps://amzn.to/2lvfH3t\n\nSven Carlin blog: https://svencarlin.com",

Good debt is when you take leverage to invest it and  the investment return is higher than the cost of debt. Bad debt is when the purchase depreciates in value and creates no income. \nThe current interest rates are at historical lows so it might be wise to use low rate financing and think about the opportunity to take equity out of your home or a personal loan to leverage your investments at the right time. \nI also discuss why one should never use margin, trade currencies on debt, be very aware of the risks and always keep the focus on the interest rate.\nGiven how central banks print money it is wise to go into debt to acquire real estate as it will be easy to pay it off over the long term. It is better to invest than to pay off a loan",

The nice thing is that it is not that difficult is you have the right mindset and look in the right places. I discuss how to approach multi bagger investments, where to look for them in the new technologies and sectors that are currently in a downturn. \nThe stocks I think have the potential to become multi baggers are discussed here: \nAMIRA NATURE FOODS - NYSE: ANFI - basmati rice India, very cheap with a P/E ratio of 5 to take advantage of the growth in India. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEl0fb9uHm0\n\nAnother interesting multi-bagger is Norilsk Nickel that is exposed to the growth in the electrical vehicle industry and also nickel prices are in a downturn, probably bottom.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqHDnl2kOP4\n\nThe third multi bagger idea is Jupai Holdings, a wealth manager in China that has a low PE ratio and a is growing at 70%. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMzq2CVRvUc\n\nFor the black swan, hedge multi bagger investment part I would suggest looking at gold miners:\nHarmony gold - HMY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhnQItl3jlg\nEldorado gold - EGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWsgJRUkbtk\nNova Gold Resources NG - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeuAXQL54Os",

This gold miner is certainly under political risk but nevertheless a sleep well investment due to the diversified assets, $1billion cash balance and positive cash flow operations even if the lose everything in Greece which is highly unlikely. The Olympias, Stratoni mine and Kisladag have huge reserves where the sum is 35 million gold ounces. If gold price increase then Eldorado could become a 10 bagger gold investment.",

I am comparing what happened to gold in the last 15 years and since 1971 when the dollar was decoupled from gold. A discussion through recessions, interest rates, inflation and stagflation, central bank activity, money printing will elaborate on what is going to happen. However, there is also a twist to the story and gold prices could also fall. I also discuss why I think gold miners are the best gold hedge investment.",

However, not everything he says should be followed blindly. What we should follow is what he does, not what he says.\nthe quotes I analyze and discuss are the following:\n1. “I try to invest in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.”\n2. Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.\n3. I don't care about what the FED will do.\n\nWe analyze Buffett's See's Candy acquisition and compare it to the Heinz acquisition, the complexity of the reinsurance business and if he doesn't care about the FED why does he hold $100 billion in cash.",

Unfortunately that doesn't exist. I explain on Facebook's balance sheet and example of how to analyze a balance sheet and what the numbers tell you.\nIt is important to see what is beyond the numbers and that is the only way to construct a proper view of the business.

Also the strength of emerging markets is going to have a huge impact on our investment portfolios. Long term trend investing is essential to achieve good long term returns. \nThe world economy is shifting towards Asia and especially China and India. Therefore it is extremely important to be invested in Asia.\n\nNobody knows where the stock market will go in the short term. However in the long term it is much easier to estimate things because the trends are clear and difficultly disrupted. By positioning your portfolio with positive structural trends as tailwinds you lower the risk of negative surprises and increase the positive ones, especially if you can do it at the same price. The story is recurrent on this channel, emerging markets are the place to invest now and in the next 30 years.\nGlobal businesses are going to operate differently than they operate now.",

Nobody knows where will stock prices go in the short term but in the long term stock prices follow earnings and business quality.

However, my concern aren't really valuations as much as book values. Book value is the actual value you get and in what should your investment returs be measured, as Buffett prefers to do. The fact is that the return on equity is around 13% while the return on buybacks is around 5% and corporations are paying three times or more the actual value of their business.",

In the stocks vs. real estate battle, real estate definitely wins on low returns and low risk while stocks win on high returns and relatively low risk.

An all weather portfolio is a very attractive investment. You limit your portfolio risk and receive satisfying investment returns by making all-weather diversification.\nIn this video I show a practical way how to build an all weather portfolio in this environment with portfolio allocation to stocks, commodity stocks, gold, real estate and treasuries. \nAn all weather portfolio performed equally to the S&P 500 in the last 30 years but with much less risk. When inflation, interest rates or economic growth change, the all-weather portfolio will be the way to go. \nI give a few stock ideas for the economic growth part and inflation growth part, discuss treasuries and discuss investments in gold. \nI wonder if Ray Dalio from Bridgewater would be happy with my portfolio structure.",

In this video I analyze three scenarios that can happen and the likelihood that it happens. It is essential to understand what is going on in order to properly analyze the risk and reward of investing in stocks.\nThe FED, ECB and BOJ will be forced to print more money as higher interest rates are not an option. if it leads to inflation I wonder weather we will have a beautiful deleveraging or a painful recession.",

In this bitcoin video I answer question about whether the bitcoin is a currency and cash, how to value bitcoin, how to price bitcoin, can it be priced and what are the main factors influencing its price.\n Every Bitcoin owner should know that he or she is a currency trader, nothing else. The price of the bitcoin depends only on the demand and supply for it, nothing else. The high volatility makes it unlikely that it will be used in transactions. But it is interesting to see why does bitcoin keep going up. \nAs for the price of bitcoin, bitcoin can go to $0 and bitcoin can go to $100,000",

Many describe value investing as obsolete, underperforming but none the less, value investing is still here. All the past fads have died, dot-com bubble, corporate raids of the 1980s, nifty-fifty stocks of the 1970s and many other fads. Value investors underperform for a while in the cycle but over the long term those are the ones remembered as the best investors in a generation. I discuss three options for the current value investor. Staying in cash, emerging markets and turning into a growth investor. Seth Klarman and Warren Buffett both underperformed for longer periods while now they are regarded the best investors out there, even if some again question that as we are in the new bubble.",

A well diversified portfolio could better buy stocks like Daimler, Lufthansa, Vonovia, Basf than the DAX index. Doing so all over the world would give good diversification at low valuations (P/E ratios, CAPE). In addition, those names provide excellent dividends. As a note, Mercedes looks extremely undervalued when its electrical vehicle program is compared to Tesla.",

Well, the definition of a stock market bubble is when stock prices diverge from business fundamentals. As S&P 500 earnings haven't been growing in the past 10 years we are clearly in a bubble. The next question is when will this bubble burst. Well, stock will crash when there will be inflation and central banks won't be able to print money anymore. When will stock prices fall? Nobody knows, but the best thing is to be prepared for a crash.",

We analyze the demand and supply for palladium, explain the palladium supply deficits, explain the ways to invest in palladium, from palladium stocks, palladium coins and bars to a palladium etf. The stocks are Norilsk Nickel, Sibanye gold and North American palladium. The Palladium ETF is PALL. \nThe analysis shows how there is a 50% potential increase in palladium prices in the next few years.",

The difficult thing to do is to know when to sell. Selling stocks is always tricky because a stock can always go up just after you sold it. The first discussed strategy, that looks towards fundamental indicators and uses fundamental analysis certainly helps in avoiding selling too early or too late. Another strategy is portfolio rebalancing that makes things much easier as you have to mechanically sell when something appreciates. The third strategy involves buying something much better, i.e. 50% better than the other portfolio holding. A better investing opportunity can always arise but you shouldn't trade too much around it. The fourth strategy is about using a stop loss. I discuss the pros and cons of using a stop loss. the fifth is not so much a strategy as the reaching of a goal, when you did it, sell your stocks and enjoy your life.",

There is so much that can go wrong that you have to be really crazy to invest, like I am :-). I discuss 10 junior miners stocks, the Van Eck Junior Miners ETF (GDXJ) is also analyzed to see how it is not really a junior gold miner ETF. the things to watch range from net present values,  political risks to gold price moves.\nDespite the risks I still think buying a good gold miner stock is much better than owning gold because the risk is maybe higher but the potential return is exponentially higher. \nThe companies analyzed are KirkLand Gold, Pretium Resources, Regis Resources, Oceanagold, Alamos gold, Helca Mining, First Majestic Silver, B2Gold, Taho, Endeavour",

It has been already 5 years since the first baby boomer retired and stock have been going only up since then. Nevertheless I found an interesting analysis form the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco where they analyze the impact of retiring baby boomers and other age impacts on stock market valuations. The outcome isn't nice at all as the S&P 500 is expected to fall to 920 points in 2025. We will see if it will actually happen but it is a good thing to keep an eye on the risks.",

The benefits are that it is effortless and as shown in the video it limits downside risk, even better, you are happy when stocks drop, and increases the returns, especially when markets are this highly valued. The S&P 500 or other index funds are excellent investments to dollar cost average but also stocks like Berkshire could be an option. \nThe sophisticated investor can also apply the DCA investment strategy when considering buying into a falling knife.",

Most people think short term and that is very dangerous when investing. I summarized Dalio's economic principles and discuss how can one position his portfolio around what will happen in the future economic environment. It is extremely important to expose a portfolio to emerging markets, precious metals, commodities and safe assets.\nRay Dalio was made famous by Anthony Robbins in his books on investing, Unshakeable and Money Master the Game. His all weather portfolio is something to really take a look at especially since it looks that we are close to a change in the economic environment.",

However, it might be cheap for a good reason or many good reasons. Looking at future catalysts, insider activity, analyzing the sector, analyzing the balance sheet, checking the sustainability of the dividend helps in determining whether an investment is a value trap or not, thus lower our investing risks and increase our returns. Investing mistakes can never be avoided but the limiting of them helps in increasing portfolio returns.",

Brazilian stocks are relatively cheap and the positive economic environment will be a tailwind.

However, the P/E ratio is just at 12 which is very illogical. Fear of competition makes this Chinese stock a bargain, something similar to what happened to Facebook post IPO. The online streaming business is expected to double in China in the next two years so the fundamentals of the sector are very strong. The stock offers extreme potential and relatively low risk for an online live video platform.\nThis is the second Chinese stock analyzed, still 14 to go, so be sure to subscribe.",

This makes Central banks a very significant player. \n\nI have read the FED's and ECB's meeting minutes, give a summary and discuss potential scenarios and how to be prepared. The situation has no historical precedents, therefore it has to be closely watched, whether you are a saver, bond holder, mutual fund investor or stock investor. A few things can happen and the best thing is to be prepared! If things go well, the FED is going to hike rates which won't be good for stocks and bonds. If a recession hits the economy, much more money printing will occur.",

ZTO Express (NYSE: ZTO) is a Chinese package delivery company growing at around 30% per year. Price earnings ratio is 33 while the company has no long term debt and enough cash from the IPO to finance its growth. This China stock looks like a very interesting growth pick for a well balanced emerging market portfolio.",

However, I'll elaborate on a stock, Berkshire Hathaway, that is less risky than the S&P 500 because it is better diversified, it is growth oriented and doesn't do shareholder value destroying buybacks and has had and will have better future returns. \n\nThose who promote index funds are doing a disservice to the community. Warren Buffett must promote them because if he would do otherwise the S&P 500 would terribly fall and the economy would enter into a recession.",

Well, two, I would buy the third but as a Dutch citizen I am highly taxed on that, if you own an IRA you are not. The potential of the first stock is 200%, second 100% in the next 12 months and the third stock will yield more than 10% per year over time. This is Buffett saying, not me. Stocks to watch, so please subscribe as I will continue to cover them! The first two are a bit up since first recommended on this channel but still great buys. Stocks to buy July 2017!\n\nDisclaimer: This is merely my opinion and nothing in this video or text should be understood as buying indication.
