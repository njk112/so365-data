            "description": "Do you guys know the concept of pick and shovel investment strategy? Ok let me explain. \nA pick-and-shovel play is an investment strategy that invests in the underlying technology needed to produce or facilitate a good or service instead of investing in the final output. It is a way to invest in an industry without having to endure the risks of the market for the final product. This investment strategy is named after the tools needed to take part in the California Gold Rush.\nIn this video I will discuss 2 high conviction stocks that can 10x if Bitcoin just doubles. First is pick and shovel play instead of the direct bet on volatile bitcoin prices and poised to provide 10x return. Whereas the second pick is undervalued stock selected based on the published research on how to pick the winning stocks and is massive beneficiary of rising bitcoin prices and is a pure bitcoin play and growing revenue massively. \nNow this video is an absolute gem for investors willing to learn lifelong \nlessons.\nLets first discuss how I selected my first stock pick… \nDo you know what is the most important piece of financial information of a company is, that explains the historical stock price performance of any company? \nWell that was quite a difficult question? Isn’t it?. Ok let me explain in simple terms. \nAssume that I am retail individual investor and I want to know what is one simple indicator which will tell me at this exact point that this stock is about to explode? \nDon’t you think this is a million dollar question?\nWell guys I got an answer for you. According to a comprehensive research study of S&P500 top growth stocks, revenue growth in combination with margins was the main reason behind stock price performance. In simple words reason of Stock price appreciation over the long term is strong revenue growth. \nNow having identified the reason of stock price performance I have eliminated the 50% headache of individual investors looking to find attractive stocks that will outperform in the future and provide abnormal returns. I use same formula to identify stocks that are currently undervalued but will outperform massively in the future. \nI used the same formula to buy bigg digital assets Inc. Ticker symbol BBKCF near 1 dollar and I am not selling anytime soon, in fact I will be adding the stock on dips. At the moment all stars are perfectly aligned. Revenue growth is massive. Listen carefully and I will explain why I am so bullish on this stock as pick and shovel play in bitcoin business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Ok let me explain in simple terms. \nAssume that I am retail individual investor and I want to know what is one simple indicator which will tell me at this exact point that this stock is about to explode? \nDon’t you think this is a million dollar question?\nWell guys I got an answer for you. According to a comprehensive research study of S&P500 top growth stocks, revenue growth in combination with margins was the main reason behind stock price performance. In simple words reason of Stock price appreciation over the long term is strong revenue growth. \nNow having identified the reason of stock price performance I have eliminated the 50% headache of individual investors looking to find attractive stocks that will outperform in the future and provide abnormal returns. I use same formula to identify stocks that are currently undervalued but will outperform massively in the future. \nI used the same formula to buy bigg digital assets Inc. Ticker symbol BBKCF near 1 dollar and I am not selling anytime soon, in fact I will be adding the stock on dips. At the moment all stars are perfectly aligned. Revenue growth is massive. Listen carefully and I will explain why I am so bullish on this stock as pick and shovel play in bitcoin business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision. I just share my views. I do not recommend basing any investment decisions on my videos. My videos are only made for educational and entertainment purposes."

            "description": "Link to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nWelcome everyone I hope you are fine and doing well today. Before discussing todays most undervalued but Hyper Growth stock that is available at dirt cheap rates and listing to Nasdaq before june. lets first discuss overall stock Market Index Technical Charts. Nasdaq is down 1486 and in percentage terms Nasdaq is down 10.5 percent after hitting all time high on February 12 and 16. Nasdaq has fallen below its trend line support but 12500 level is proving a short term support. RSI levels are also hovering near oversold levels. Historically Nasdaq has bounced back from these levels. Watch carefully and you will notice that every time Nasdaq touch these RSI levels it bounces back with even more force. I see Nasdaq consolidating till 12000 and if you want to be more cautious then you can adopt accumulation strategy between 12.2k to 11.2k levels. \nNow lets discuss our 3x challenge portfolio. My plan is to convert 300k to approximately 1 million dollars. In 3 to 9 months time. \nI have included 3 stocks to the portfolio so far. First stock is Bigg Digital Assets Inc ticker symbol BBKCF. I first bought it near 1 dollar and we are up 38% I regret not going big time on this one. I should have bought 100k worth of shares. I see it going to 3 plus pretty soon and then 10 in 12 months time. There are several catalysts lined up that will set the stage for next rally. \nEvery Sunday I post technical alerts on our portfolio stock picks highlighting entry support and resistance levels so patreon and discord members can make informed decisions every week. If you are interested to join and get alerts the very moment I buy or sell any stock then link to join is given in the description.\nThere are so many details that I want to discuss about this stock. Like this video and comment below if you want another video on this stock. I am so confident about this stock and believe it can easily 3x your money in short term. \nNext stock is SCYNEXIS Inc ticker symbol SCYX I bought it near 8 dollar and now it is still trading near 8.26 dollars. But I am confident that it will move soon. FDA action date for their antifungal date is set to June 1. And given the huge target market and sales potential average target price of top wall street analysts is set to 22 dollars at least. I see it doubling on FDA approval. Chances of approval are high given the phase 3 positive data. \nThird stock is HUT8 mining Corp ticker symbol HUTMF it is the most undervalued stock on this earth. I challenge you to fine me another stock that is undervalued as compared to this stock. I see it hitting 20 plus this year. Although I first shared this stock near 4 dollars and later it jumped to 13 dollars where I recommended profit taking now once again I am buying this stock taking benefit of the dip in market.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

                "description": "Link to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nWelcome everyone I hope you are fine and doing well today. Before discussing todays most undervalued but Hyper Growth stock that is available at dirt cheap rates and listing to Nasdaq before june. lets first discuss overall stock Market Index Technical Charts. Nasdaq is down 1486 and in percentage terms Nasdaq is down 10.5 percent after hitting all time high on February 12 and 16. Nasdaq has fallen below its trend line support but 12500 level is proving a short term support. RSI levels are also hovering near oversold levels. Historically Nasdaq has bounced back from these levels. Watch carefully and you will notice that every time Nasdaq touch these RSI levels it bounces back with even more force. I see Nasdaq consolidating till 12000 and if you want to be more cautious then you can adopt accumulation strategy between 12.2k to 11.2k levels. \nNow lets discuss our 3x challenge portfolio. My plan is to convert 300k to approximately 1 million dollars. In 3 to 9 months time. \nI have included 3 stocks to the portfolio so far. First stock is Bigg Digital Assets Inc ticker symbol BBKCF. I first bought it near 1 dollar and we are up 38% I regret not going big time on this one. I should have bought 100k worth of shares. I see it going to 3 plus pretty soon and then 10 in 12 months time. There are several catalysts lined up that will set the stage for next rally. \nEvery Sunday I post technical alerts on our portfolio stock picks highlighting entry support and resistance levels so patreon and discord members can make informed decisions every week. If you are interested to join and get alerts the very moment I buy or sell any stock then link to join is given in the description.\nThere are so many details that I want to discuss about this stock. Like this video and comment below if you want another video on this stock. I am so confident about this stock and believe it can easily 3x your money in short term. \nNext stock is SCYNEXIS Inc ticker symbol SCYX I bought it near 8 dollar and now it is still trading near 8.26 dollars. But I am confident that it will move soon. FDA action date for their antifungal date is set to June 1. And given the huge target market and sales potential average target price of top wall street analysts is set to 22 dollars at least. I see it doubling on FDA approval. Chances of approval are high given the phase 3 positive data. \nThird stock is HUT8 mining Corp ticker symbol HUTMF it is the most undervalued stock on this earth. I challenge you to fine me another stock that is undervalued as compared to this stock. I see it hitting 20 plus this year. Although I first shared this stock near 4 dollars and later it jumped to 13 dollars where I recommended profit taking now once again I am buying this stock taking benefit of the dip in market.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

This video is to show you my research and analysis for entertainment and information purposes only. I just share my opinion and you need to do your own due diligence before making any investment decision. \n\nWith that being said let get into it, in this video I will discuss a monster growth penny stock. Growth numbers are really amazing but the surprising fact that company doesn’t spend a single penny on customer acquisition will blow your mind.

I see this 40 cents penny stock taking off this year to 4 plus in short term and then 10 in the long term. Stock price is in upward trend since april so you guys don’t blame me for the pump up. Due diligence is must before making any decision. Now just a quick announcement. I seriously don’t know what’s stopping you guys from minting money??? In last 10 days I have shared 5 stocks with my discord members and if you had put 500 dollars in each stock you could have doubled your money in 10 days or at least could have earned 52% return on yesterday’s closing prices. This Sunday I will be sharing another 10x stock with my discord members. You can access our 3x my money in 3 months challenge portfolio and 10x challenge portfolio.

                "description": "What if I tell you that there is a Biotech company that has developed a product that no other company on this planet offers so far. And the best thing is the company is starting commercialization of its product this year not only in US but all over the globe as well.\nLink to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n This penny stock is currently trading near 4 dollars with a market cap of just 200 million but target market is in billions. They currently have no competitors in the market so in my opinion this stock can easily jump to 10x levels once sales start. In this video I will present my investment rationale and calculations for my revenue estimates and 10x target price. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Because this company is set to grow perpetually unless human beings get extinct due to some unavoidable circumstances.\nLink to join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\n And that extinction is not going to happen soon so I believe their revenues and share price will continue to grow steadily as growth will continue its business model is also pandemic resistant and not affected by it all.

Today I am really excited to share one of Cathie Woods's favorite growth giant with you and after knowing today's investment opportunity and my investment rationale you will thank me and of course Cathie wood for rest of your life. Because this company is set to grow perpetually unless human beings get extinct due to some unavoidable circumstances.\nLink to join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\n And that extinction is not going to happen soon so I believe their revenues and share price will continue to grow steadily as growth will continue its business model is also pandemic resistant and not affected by it all. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has more than 1.2 billion dollars at stake in this single company through different ETFs as compared to 2.5 billion dollars in tesla. Meaning this company occupy half of the space in Cathie wood’s portfolio then Tesla in total. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Link to Join On Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nWelcome guys in this video I will present a very comprehensive analysis of NIO stock and show you with evidence that how I earned 5x return in NIO stock and then discuss how I will 10x my money again with NIO stock. I believe NIO will change forever after the huge upcoming catalysts in early January that will set NIO towards its Journey to 10x growth. My short term target is 120 now and long term 10x. I do not have a slightest doubt in my mind about my target price and time frame. NIO is an easy money stock and investors are missing important details that I will share today so you too can ride the 10x rally with me the same way we rode the 5x rally from 10 to 50 plus. Also at the end of this video I will also share my trading strategy time frame of short term target price and buying selling levels.\nRemember watching completely is key to understanding my strategy. If you don’t watch completely I won’t lose anything but if you watch you will learn something that will change your investment returns forever.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

But I have a big surprise for you guys because I have found massive game-changing details regarding NIO that will change everything for NIO and for you and me as Investors as well. I do not have slightest doubt in my mind that after these announcements NIO will be changed forever and journey to 10x will accelerate. Also at the end of this video I will guide you about perfect time to buy NIO and complete trading strategy to follow so do watch the last part completely with attention. Because buying and selling at right time is equally important apart from identifying the growth stock. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

                "description": "Link to Join on Patreon & Discord\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nWow guys  I am really excited because NIO stock is Up 25% in just 5 days. But I have a big surprise for you guys because I have found massive game-changing details regarding NIO that will change everything for NIO and for you and me as Investors as well. I do not have slightest doubt in my mind that after these announcements NIO will be changed forever and journey to 10x will accelerate. Also at the end of this video I will guide you about perfect time to buy NIO and complete trading strategy to follow so do watch the last part completely with attention. Because buying and selling at right time is equally important apart from identifying the growth stock. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Or should you book profit or loss assuming the merger game is over in Hyliion? Fourth can Hyliion go to 55 again so I can sell at a higher level?

I request you all to watch the whole video very carefully because I will be building my investment case in front of you. Listen carefully, as you can see here tesla is down almost 18% after touching 52 weeks high of 502. After the 5 for 1 split tesla has been struggling to jump back to its all-time high. And depending on news items we might see a further dip in next week. But that’s the thing investors should not be worried about. Now listen carefully I have an important point to clear. Let me show you the bigger picture. In the last 10 years, tesla is up by almost 10000% and on 1 years basis tesla is up by 750% and on 6 months basis tesla is up by 356%",

I request you all to watch the whole video very carefully because I will be building my investment case in front of you. Listen carefully, as you can see here tesla is down almost 18% after touching 52 weeks high of 502. After the 5 for 1 split tesla has been struggling to jump back to its all-time high. And depending on news items we might see a further dip in next week. But that’s the thing investors should not be worried about. Now listen carefully I have an important point to clear. Let me show you the bigger picture. In the last 10 years, tesla is up by almost 10000% and on 1 years basis tesla is up by 750% and on 6 months basis tesla is up by 356%"

So do watch this video completely and don’t miss key details like why I believe that there will be a huge rally and then a steep fall in Tesla stock in next month, what are the suitable buying levels to ride this volatility and when to book profits in tesla instead of getting stuck at higher levels due to higher volatility. \nUse this Link to Join on Patreon & Discord for Free till September 30th.\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISXX\nThe below Patreon page is Sold Out\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

I will show you a very interesting thing regarding workhorse and institutional buying. I believe something big is cooking in it. Workhorse can double in 3 to 4 months. I will also show you how workhorse is closely working with USPS since the last 4 years to develop a purpose-built vehicle I believe big news is around the corner.",

I think both the companies are great investments at the moment and investors can earn a handsome return on their investments in the short term due to the fast-approaching catalysts. I will show you a very interesting thing regarding workhorse and institutional buying. I believe something big is cooking in it. Workhorse can double in 3 to 4 months. I will also show you how workhorse is closely working with USPS since the last 4 years to develop a purpose-built vehicle I believe big news is around the corner."

And when workhorse will become profitable? Also, I will discuss the USPS contract and explain to you my rationale that why I believe that the chances of workhorse winning the USPS contract is at least 75%.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys! In this video, I will present an in-depth analysis of Tesla stock and will discuss solid reasons in favor of my investment thesis. I believe tesla is still undervalued and can provide handsome gains in the future. I will also discuss everything you need to know related to stock split dates and how to calculate post-split price. And what target price you should keep in mind before and after the split. \nSpreadsheet link.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/61k7z47r32sq4bk/Tesla%20Stock%20Split%20Calculations.xlsx?dl=0\n\n\nIn my last video I recommended my viewers to buy tesla stock immediately after the announcement of 5 for 1 stock split. I clearly saw an opportunity to earn big time so I got really excited and wanted to share the opportunity with my viewers as well. And now I am really glad that I shared my views timely with my viewers. Tesla’s stock price has increased by 49% in just 10 days. I am not saying that these gains are due to my analysis or prediction. \nBut identifying and recognizing a catalyst in a timely manner is a huge thing. I have received hundreds of comments that the stock split doesn’t change anything. And I am just giving them one simple answer “stock price performance tends to differ with you”. \nI know and 100 % agree that the stock split doesn’t change any fundamental thing. But stock splits do indicate a lot of positive things about a company. \nA stock split is a sign of a company’s confidence in its near-term growth prospects, as no company needs to lower its share price if it’s expected to drop on its own. Tesla expects that its share price is increasing rapidly and will continue to increase in the near future so they decided to issue stock split to lower its price. Also, higher liquidity means a company can raise capital from the market pretty easily. Tesla can raise billions from the stock market by issuing just 1 or 2 percent shares to institutional investors.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

                "description": "Welcome guys! In this video, I will present an in-depth analysis of Tesla stock and will discuss solid reasons in favor of my investment thesis. I believe tesla is still undervalued and can provide handsome gains in the future. I will also discuss everything you need to know related to stock split dates and how to calculate post-split price. And what target price you should keep in mind before and after the split. \nSpreadsheet link.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/61k7z47r32sq4bk/Tesla%20Stock%20Split%20Calculations.xlsx?dl=0\n\n\nIn my last video I recommended my viewers to buy tesla stock immediately after the announcement of 5 for 1 stock split. I clearly saw an opportunity to earn big time so I got really excited and wanted to share the opportunity with my viewers as well. And now I am really glad that I shared my views timely with my viewers. Tesla’s stock price has increased by 49% in just 10 days. I am not saying that these gains are due to my analysis or prediction. \nBut identifying and recognizing a catalyst in a timely manner is a huge thing. I have received hundreds of comments that the stock split doesn’t change anything. And I am just giving them one simple answer “stock price performance tends to differ with you”. \nI know and 100 % agree that the stock split doesn’t change any fundamental thing. But stock splits do indicate a lot of positive things about a company. \nA stock split is a sign of a company’s confidence in its near-term growth prospects, as no company needs to lower its share price if it’s expected to drop on its own. Tesla expects that its share price is increasing rapidly and will continue to increase in the near future so they decided to issue stock split to lower its price. Also, higher liquidity means a company can raise capital from the market pretty easily. Tesla can raise billions from the stock market by issuing just 1 or 2 percent shares to institutional investors.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss NIO stock in detail. I will review its last week’s performance and then comment on what investors should expect from NIO stock in the coming days. Investors are ignoring a lot of positive changes that took place last week. I believe the fundamental story of NIO has totally changed; now I am even more excited about NIO. NIO is getting de-risked with each passing week. First I will discuss the last week’s performance and events related to NIO stock and then at the end, I would mention the key points that investors should keep in mind to make their future investment decision regarding NIO stock and will also show you how you can easily trade NIO stock on a daily basis through technical analysis. \nNIO started last week with a lot of excitement about results but ended up disappointing investors through poor price performance. I know most of the investors are disappointed that NIO didn’t sustain its Tuesday high of 15.45 dollars despite stellar results and fell almost 20% after opening strong at 15.45 dollars. And on top of that investors were really frustrated because apparently there was no obvious reason for this sudden price fall. It felt like some unseen thing was pulling NIO stock down. There is a rumor that JP Morgan chase is selling its stake in NIO stock. Maybe it is true because institutional investors tend to take benefit of high liquidity availability on key catalyst days. But there is no confirmation yet. In my last video, I also recommended viewers to play earnings announcement by buying before at lower levels and selling high after the announcement. May be JP Morgan Chase took it seriously.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision. I just share my views.

                "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss NIO stock in detail. I will review its last week’s performance and then comment on what investors should expect from NIO stock in the coming days. Investors are ignoring a lot of positive changes that took place last week. I believe the fundamental story of NIO has totally changed; now I am even more excited about NIO. NIO is getting de-risked with each passing week. First I will discuss the last week’s performance and events related to NIO stock and then at the end, I would mention the key points that investors should keep in mind to make their future investment decision regarding NIO stock and will also show you how you can easily trade NIO stock on a daily basis through technical analysis. \nNIO started last week with a lot of excitement about results but ended up disappointing investors through poor price performance. I know most of the investors are disappointed that NIO didn’t sustain its Tuesday high of 15.45 dollars despite stellar results and fell almost 20% after opening strong at 15.45 dollars. And on top of that investors were really frustrated because apparently there was no obvious reason for this sudden price fall. It felt like some unseen thing was pulling NIO stock down. There is a rumor that JP Morgan chase is selling its stake in NIO stock. Maybe it is true because institutional investors tend to take benefit of high liquidity availability on key catalyst days. But there is no confirmation yet. In my last video, I also recommended viewers to play earnings announcement by buying before at lower levels and selling high after the announcement. May be JP Morgan Chase took it seriously.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision. I just share my views.

I am sensing a huge accumulation in NIO stock but I will talk about this accumulation and short term earnings play strategy at the end of this video. \nAlso, I will show you a funny thing about the change of NIOs stock price target by Goldman Sachs.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss two closely related EV companies namely workhorse Group and Lords town motors and will outline a clear strategy for you guys to make some good money from these two companies in the short term. 3 huge catalysts are coming for both of the companies in the near term that will drive their price even higher. Watch completely so you would not miss key details about these catalysts that will fuel the upcoming huge rally. First let's discuss some recent news items.\nYou might have heard that Lords town motor is going public. Lordstown Motors announced that it has agreed to a merger with Diamond Peak Holdings ticker symbol DPHC in a deal that will provide it with the funding needed to put its electric pickup truck Endurance into production. Post-merger the new entity will trade under the ticker symbol RIDE. Remember Lords Town is merging with DPHC and after the merger, their combined symbol will be R I D E RIDE. This transaction will provide 675 million dollars to lords town motors valuing the company at 1.6 billion dollars.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

I will explain what this business model means for the current stock price of NIO and for the future of NIO as a competitor of Tesla in China. Actually I am considering revising my yearly target upwards from the current target of 50 dollars after seeing NIO's current business model.\nAlso, I will present a detailed technical analysis of NIO stock so you would be able to make better-informed decisions about your investments in NIO in the current scenario. \nMore importantly, I will outline an effective day trading strategy, that you would be able to use to earn a minimum of 4 to 500 dollars on a daily basis from NIO stock price movements with minimum risk-taking. Please keep in mind I present technical analysis at the end of my video so do watch till the end so you would not miss on the opportunity to earn money from NIO even when it is in the consolidation phase.\nNow the first and the most important point of the NIO’s business plan is that NIO is setting up a battery asset management company in August this year and second is the announcement of the battery renting scheme and EC6 launch. This battery asset management company and BAAS, battery as a service model news might sound simple news but if you give it a deep thought you would be surprised to know that this business model would allow NIO to beat major EV players in China. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Ticker symbol TELL\n\nTo help everyone understand what I mean by explosive returns and negligible to no risk at all, I would like to give you an example of my last top penny stock performer “American Lithium Corporation” ticker symbol LIACF. 17 days ago I recommended my viewers to buy LIACF when it was trading near .66 cents because at that price level the risk to reward ratio was in the buyer's favor. The risk was little to none but the reward potential was 300%. By risk I mean chances of the stock price going down and by reward potential, I mean chances of price going up. And you would be surprised to know that its price has more than doubled in just 17 days and now it is consolidating and trading near 1.36 dollars. I still believe it can double again given the high growth potential.

And as always you will see that I was right. But before going into details I want to highlight one thing, in my last video I gave my viewers a short term trading tip to make quick money from falling NIO stock price. \nBased on Technical analysis I recommended my viewers to buy NIO shares near 11 instead of buying at higher levels. Now you would be surprised to know that after touching 11 dollars its price has bounced back and now it is trading near 12.4 again. Remember I give these tips apart from my long term price target of 50 dollars. I would highly recommend you to watch the video in which I showed calculations of my target price of 50 dollars for NIO. Also like this video and subscribe to my channel if you are interested to find our trading opportunities like these on weekly basis.\n\nBefore telling you about the upcoming news items I want to address two immediate concerns of investors the first one is why the price is falling after touching 15.9 and second I want to answer the Goldman Sachs on the downgrade of NIO stock.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

And based on the latest news and technical analysis and I will guide you whether to buy it at current price levels or not? And I will share my target price with you guys at the end of this video after analyzing everything in front of you and also I will outline an effective strategy based on technical indicators to take entry at the most appropriate price level.\nThe stock price increased by 13% in a single day on Monday extending the rally to 40 percent in just 5 trading days. \nBut still, the important question is whether it can continue to climb higher or it will take a breather? A lot of people can be tempted to book profit after a 40% price jump. What about you wouldn’t you like to book profit in a share that has jumped 40% in just 5 days? Yes, a lot of people will be tempted to book profit but let's see if you will change your answer if I change the scenario of my question a little bit.\nWould you like to sell your tesla stock given that it has increased more than 500 percent in the last 12 months? \nWell that’s a difficult question and same as you a lot of experienced stock brokers are also confused about its valuation. \nNow before discussing technical points and giving you my opinion I want to show you an interesting thing about two different points of views on the tesla price target.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

You can imagine the potential of their niche product by reading this, they are the only local US company selected to develop a next generation delivery vehicle for United States Postal Service.

First you need to be clear of one thing that Hyliion Nikola and Tesla motors are direct competitors in Electric Truck Business.Now if I say to you that Hyliions trucks are better than Nikola’s trucks than you can imagine what Hyliions stock price would be in the future. Hyliion will be merging with Tortoise Acquisition corp ticker symbol SHLL which will change to HYLN after merger. So by SHLL I mean Hyln Hyliion stock. I still believe it is undervalued at the moment and it can provide double-digit returns in the near future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

First you need to be clear of one thing that Hyliion Nikola and Tesla motors are direct competitors in Electric Truck Business.Now if I say to you that Hyliions trucks are better than Nikola’s trucks than you can imagine what Hyliions stock price would be in the future. Hyliion will be merging with Tortoise Acquisition corp ticker symbol SHLL which will change to HYLN after merger. So by SHLL I mean Hyln Hyliion stock. I still believe it is undervalued at the moment and it can provide double-digit returns in the near future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

You will be surprised to know at one point in time its price increased by almost 85% and now it is falling again. Always keep this in mind that you need to buy stocks with a pre-defined plan and that plan should to book profits at reasonable levels. Ideally you should have booked profits at this level as all technical indicators were in overbought territory. Otherwise you will end up at the start line again. In coming days I will be making video about when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock based on technical indicators. \nAnd the other stock that I highlighted for quick gains was Iron Mountain ticker symbol IRM its price has increased by almost 35% in a matter of just 15 days also one thing to note that IRM announced a handsome quarterly dividend of .618 dollars per share. \n3rd stock that I highlighted for quick gains of 50 to 100k was Berkshire Hathaway, at one point in time its price increased by 40000 dollars but now it is falling. Always remember to book profits at reasonable levels.\nBy following my top 3 stock picks you could have earned more than 50% return on your investment in matter of just 15 days.
