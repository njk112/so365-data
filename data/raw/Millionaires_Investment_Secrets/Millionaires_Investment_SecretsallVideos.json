            "description": "In my last video I talked about the top most important indicator that explains the historical stock price performance of growth stocks. If you missed here is the two line summary. \nThis is a real price chart of a stock that I will cover today.\nIf you are at this point and starts thinking that what the hell happened that this stock jumped from 1 to 25 dollars in just 4 months. And most importantly how you can identify today the stocks that will jump massively in the future like this?\nWell the answer is simple and hiding in plain sight listen carefully according to published research “Revenue growth numbers coupled with margins improvement” explains the rapid stock price performance in the long run.\nHere is the real life explanation. This company reported 2700 percent revenue growth in November when it was trading near 1 dollar and since than their revenue growth is astronomical, On march 1 they reported 3800% increase in their Q2 revenue numbers. And now what if I tell you that they will be reporting even higher growth numbers for FQ3??\nStock price will continue to outperform until management continue to outperform on revenue side. \nThe company is none other than the Voyager Digital Ltd. US Ticker symbol VYGVF  and Canadian Ticker Symbol VYGR. \nVoyager Digital Holdings Inc. operates as a crypto-asset broker that provides retail and institutional investors with a turnkey solution to trade crypto assets. \nVoyager's business is unique built to scale and excel in both up and down markets, as customers tend to trade more when the markets move in either direction. Additionally when markets are flat, Voyager still earns revenue on account balances due to interest model.\nVYGVF is targeting 50 billion AUM Assets under management in 2023 as compared to prior target of 20 billion AUM in 2025 due to rapid adoption of its platform as a result of interest offerings. Roughly 10% of AUM falls to bottom line. 5 billion in bottom line means this stock is massively undervalued at current rate. You can maintain and grow your account with voyager and at the same time earn upto 6 to 10 percent interest rate on your account.\nkey metrics for the month ended February 28, 2021 are un believable and march numbers will be even better.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Do you guys know the concept of pick and shovel investment strategy? Ok let me explain. \nA pick-and-shovel play is an investment strategy that invests in the underlying technology needed to produce or facilitate a good or service instead of investing in the final output. It is a way to invest in an industry without having to endure the risks of the market for the final product. This investment strategy is named after the tools needed to take part in the California Gold Rush.\nIn this video I will discuss 2 high conviction stocks that can 10x if Bitcoin just doubles. First is pick and shovel play instead of the direct bet on volatile bitcoin prices and poised to provide 10x return. Whereas the second pick is undervalued stock selected based on the published research on how to pick the winning stocks and is massive beneficiary of rising bitcoin prices and is a pure bitcoin play and growing revenue massively. \nNow this video is an absolute gem for investors willing to learn lifelong \nlessons.\nLets first discuss how I selected my first stock pick… \nDo you know what is the most important piece of financial information of a company is, that explains the historical stock price performance of any company? \nWell that was quite a difficult question? Isn’t it?. Ok let me explain in simple terms. \nAssume that I am retail individual investor and I want to know what is one simple indicator which will tell me at this exact point that this stock is about to explode? \nDon’t you think this is a million dollar question?\nWell guys I got an answer for you. According to a comprehensive research study of S&P500 top growth stocks, revenue growth in combination with margins was the main reason behind stock price performance. In simple words reason of Stock price appreciation over the long term is strong revenue growth. \nNow having identified the reason of stock price performance I have eliminated the 50% headache of individual investors looking to find attractive stocks that will outperform in the future and provide abnormal returns. I use same formula to identify stocks that are currently undervalued but will outperform massively in the future. \nI used the same formula to buy bigg digital assets Inc. Ticker symbol BBKCF near 1 dollar and I am not selling anytime soon, in fact I will be adding the stock on dips. At the moment all stars are perfectly aligned. Revenue growth is massive. Listen carefully and I will explain why I am so bullish on this stock as pick and shovel play in bitcoin business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

In this video I will discuss 2 of my favorite stocks that are growing massively. I am confident I will be able to 3x my money with these stocks in 3 to 9 months time because these companies have unique business model. Stock market correction or crash their stock price is increasing. One stock is included in my recently launched 3x challenge portfolio and 2nd was announced before the launch of this portfolio so it is apart from my 3x challenge portfolio but still I am bullish on it. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Lab grown diamonds. Trends are shifting in US and around the globe. Do you know that 80% percent of American brides get a diamond engagement ring and according to company research 70% of the millennial are willing to buy lab grown diamonds? Sales will see a significant boost in coming quarters. Millennials call lab grown diamonds \"ethically sourced\" due to no abuses of diamond miners and consider them green due to the reduced impact to the environment and the cost is about 30% less than a mined diamond. Both mined diamonds and lab grown diamonds have same properties and look same. \nThe company is none other than the Charles & Colvard, Ltd. NASDAQ ticker CTHR. Charles & Colvard is the pioneer of lab-created moissanite, a rare gemstone formed form silicon carbide. The company is well known due to its pinnacle Forever One™ Moissanite and Caydia™ lab grown diamond brand. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Link to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nWelcome everyone I hope you are fine and doing well today. \nIn this video I will discuss 3companies leading the quest for Holy Grail of Alzheimer’s Drug. Big street funds like Black Rock and Vanguard are betting big on these stocks. Insiders are also increasing their holdings. All three companies offer unique risk and return potential. \nBut before going into details let’s discuss the progress of our 3x challenge portfolio.We are up almost 30% on our first stock. At one time we were up like 80% from our initial buying level of 1 dollar but later profit taking started and it took a massive dip and now consolidating nicely after selling pressure is absorbed. I will be adding more if it dips further I am not a fan of buying on the big green days. I want to accumulate at lower levels.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision. I just share my views.

            "description": "Link to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nWelcome everyone I hope you are fine and doing well today. Before discussing todays most undervalued but Hyper Growth stock that is available at dirt cheap rates and listing to Nasdaq before june. lets first discuss overall stock Market Index Technical Charts. Nasdaq is down 1486 and in percentage terms Nasdaq is down 10.5 percent after hitting all time high on February 12 and 16. Nasdaq has fallen below its trend line support but 12500 level is proving a short term support. RSI levels are also hovering near oversold levels. Historically Nasdaq has bounced back from these levels. Watch carefully and you will notice that every time Nasdaq touch these RSI levels it bounces back with even more force. I see Nasdaq consolidating till 12000 and if you want to be more cautious then you can adopt accumulation strategy between 12.2k to 11.2k levels. \nNow lets discuss our 3x challenge portfolio. My plan is to convert 300k to approximately 1 million dollars. In 3 to 9 months time. \nI have included 3 stocks to the portfolio so far. First stock is Bigg Digital Assets Inc ticker symbol BBKCF. I first bought it near 1 dollar and we are up 38% I regret not going big time on this one. I should have bought 100k worth of shares. I see it going to 3 plus pretty soon and then 10 in 12 months time. There are several catalysts lined up that will set the stage for next rally. \nEvery Sunday I post technical alerts on our portfolio stock picks highlighting entry support and resistance levels so patreon and discord members can make informed decisions every week. If you are interested to join and get alerts the very moment I buy or sell any stock then link to join is given in the description.\nThere are so many details that I want to discuss about this stock. Like this video and comment below if you want another video on this stock. I am so confident about this stock and believe it can easily 3x your money in short term. \nNext stock is SCYNEXIS Inc ticker symbol SCYX I bought it near 8 dollar and now it is still trading near 8.26 dollars. But I am confident that it will move soon. FDA action date for their antifungal date is set to June 1. And given the huge target market and sales potential average target price of top wall street analysts is set to 22 dollars at least. I see it doubling on FDA approval. Chances of approval are high given the phase 3 positive data. \nThird stock is HUT8 mining Corp ticker symbol HUTMF it is the most undervalued stock on this earth. I challenge you to fine me another stock that is undervalued as compared to this stock. I see it hitting 20 plus this year. Although I first shared this stock near 4 dollars and later it jumped to 13 dollars where I recommended profit taking now once again I am buying this stock taking benefit of the dip in market.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Link to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nUntil and unless you are hiding under a rock you must have heard the names of legendary investors Cathie Wood and Chamath Palihapitiya. Let me ask you a question? Do you trust their experience knowledge wisdom and accomplishments? Well if your answer is yes then this video is for you to watch completely because I have found a stock that according to Cathie and Chamath’s predictions will be worth 10 times its current price in 12 months time and 20 times its current value in long term. Even before the video this stock was up 45% after we first bought this stock and even now it is up significantly despite the correction chaos in the market. This will be my absolute best high conviction stock play because even US government is using their security features. Just give me few minutes and I bet you will love it too. This company is related to bitcoin trading meaning its main source of revenue is commission from bitcoin trading volume. And according to Chamath palijipitiya and Cathie wood bitcoin is the future and its trading volume is expected to surge massively.\nNow watch these calculations carefully you will not be able to resist liking this video in return. Current market cap of the company is 172.55 million dollars.  And name of this high conviction play is Bigg Digital Assets Inc. US ticker symbol BBKCF and Canadian Ticker Symbol BIGG. Now what if I tell you that company is about to generate 36 million dollars in revenue in 2021.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Now again listen carefully because you will have to choose option A or Option B to make your investment decision.\nLink to Join on Patreon To Receive Early & Exclusive Access\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nFirst option is traditional method where Mr. A will undergo a surgery where surgeons will have to cut his body with knife to access the affected area and then perform the procedure. Cutting ones access to the operative field risks infection and excessive bleeding. And on top of that the process is expensive.\nNow the 2nd option is that Mr. A can opt for knifeless surgery. Knifeless surgery with highly intense focused ultrasound (HIFU) acts through the intact body surface eliminating the risks of knife, access, bleeding, infection and wound care. This revolutionary procedure is effective, but simpler, less risky and cheaper than surgery. And FDA approved.\nNow which procedure you will chose? Option A or Option B? \nThe rational answer will be Option B the knifeless surgery procedure because it eliminates the risks of knife, access, bleeding, infection and wound care. \nNow the company offering this revolutionary FDA approved knife less procedure is EDAP TMS.

One of the stocks is chosen from the recommendations of Cathie wood interview video and the other 2 are my favorite Biotech stocks. Number two stock will really surprise you when you look at the market cap and upcoming phase 2 results of its Alzheimer drug. 3rd stock is an absolute undervalued gem and 70% of the shares are owned by institutions. JP Morgan Chase & Morgan Stanley are scoping up shares from the market. \nLink to Join on Patreon To Receive Early & Exclusive Access\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

This into is going to be long but you should listen carefully if you want to earn 10x returns in 3 months time.In this video I will discuss one stock that according to Cathie wood investment rationale can provide 10x returns in 3 months time. \nLink to Join on Patreon To Receive Early & Exclusive Access\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nKeep in mind I am not saying this stock is owned by Cathie wood I am saying by applying her investment formula this stock can provide us you and me 10x returns. Wonder how? Listen carefully Cathie wood often buy biotech companies that are about to announce their phase 2 or 3 positive trials result. She will buy that stock a few months before the trials results announcement and then sell these stocks once they jump massively.  For example she bought Seres therapeutics near 4 and after the positive result announcement this stock jumped 700 percent in one day and later to 10x levels. And then she started selling. Similarly we can do the same thing.  Buy the biotech stock that can provide 1000% return in 3 months’ time on the announcement of their positive trial results just like seres therapeutics and SAVA stock which jumped from 10 to 125 before cooling off to 50s. \n#anvs stock\n#anvs\n#anovis Bio\n#anovis\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Meaning they offer high return potential but with very little risk taking at current prices. \nLink to join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\nI am not saying that penny stocks are not risky but risk and reward potential is in buyers favor. One of my favorite 10x penny stock company has developed a product that no other biotech company on this world offers at the moment. I last covered this penny stock in January in my video near 4 and later a very positive news of new manufacturing facility came out and it jumped to 6.67 but fell to 5.19 as company decided to raise 20 million dollars. The name of this company is Volition Rx Limited and their NYSE ticker symbol is VNRX.  I believe this cash raise will be long term positive for the company as they will spend this cash on sales and marketing expenses. This cash raise is the reason to add stock on dip instead of taking small profits and leave. Massive manufacturing and sales efforts are about to start.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

I see this 40 cents penny stock taking off this year to 4 plus in short term and then 10 in the long term. Stock price is in upward trend since april so you guys don’t blame me for the pump up. Due diligence is must before making any decision. Now just a quick announcement. I seriously don’t know what’s stopping you guys from minting money??? In last 10 days I have shared 5 stocks with my discord members and if you had put 500 dollars in each stock you could have doubled your money in 10 days or at least could have earned 52% return on yesterday’s closing prices. This Sunday I will be sharing another 10x stock with my discord members. You can access our 3x my money in 3 months challenge portfolio and 10x challenge portfolio.

            "description": "Welcome everyone today I have something very important to discuss regarding the 60 cents penny stock ALLM that I covered yesterday and what’s happening with SAVA stock at the moment? And was our soft reminder of profit taking at 10x levels was a wrong call that tanked the stock momentum?. Also why DTEA stock fell suddenly today should you hold or sell? \nLink to Join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nThis is a short video and you need to watch it completely to understand fully. I have observed a very strange cult like following now days from you guys that is not healthy activity. The moment I post a video about any stock it jumps by 30 to 40 percent in few minutes. For example look at this chart. You can match the timing of this video and stock price jump on the chart.  Although most of my Past picks have outperformed beyond expectations but you should not buy any stock that I cover without doing your own due diligence. If you are doing so then you are not only risking your money but also putting others money at risk by buying those stocks without a proper plan. Like ratio of my videos are between 97 to 99 percent. But I see few maybe 2 to 3 people commenting that I am a pump and dump con artist. This really hurts me because they are commenting without knowing the truth. They think we buy big time and then dump but They don’t know what I wrote to my discord members when I suggested them ALLM stock.\nLet me read this from my old discord post.\nif you can spare 1000 dollars for 1 to 2 years max than buy this company to 20x your money. Kindly note penny stocks are extremely risky stocks. Alliance Bioenergy Plus Ticker Symbol ALLM. Biden Administration and clean fuel push with company updating about tech and sales starting in 2022 will set the stage for gradual rise to 5 and then 10 dollars. i will be buying shares with 2000 dollars. Even if i lose 2000 i have no issues. but price this low i dont think i will lose money.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

I am adding NIO to my low risk 2x my money in 6 months challenge portfolio after NIO perfectly hit my 5x target price of 50 from 10 dollars.\nLink to join on Patreon \nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nearly followers of the channel know that I had a target price of 50 for NIO by December end and long term 250+ target price for NIO even when it was trading near 10 dollars. In this video I will be revising my June 2021 target price to 120+ and long term target price to 350+ based on further confirmation of my investment thesis and some latest developments that you should know because I believe investors are missing some important pieces of the puzzle there is one solid reason that will send NIO to 120 plus in june 2021. I will randomly select 1 person from comments who will rightly identify and mention the reason in comments after watching the video. I will award him VIP discord membership for 1 month as a reward. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

But from this scamy name of Citron Research it looks like a research firm which in fact it is not. Anyhow I will just say that citron research website is saying that NIO is overvalued and current price is unjustified and gave target price of 25 dollars. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

This vides is going to be really informative because in this video I will be covering 4 high growth stocks that I believe one should buy now to sell after 10x growth. To aid you in your decision making I will ask you a simple question regarding each stock that you should answer to decide whether you should invest in it or not?\nThe stocks I will be discussing today are currently depressed due to overall volatility in the market but the growth trend of these companies is still intact. Their revenue and earnings are improving and future outlook is outstanding but this volatility and price anomaly gives us a unique opportunity to buy Great stocks at cheap rates.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Link to Join on Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nWelcome guys in this video I will present a very comprehensive analysis of tesla stock. First I will quickly guide you whether you should BUY HOLD OR SELL tesla after the earnings announcement. Well consensus estimate of revenue is $8.26 Billion and EPS of $0.56 per share. \nNow listen carefully, I am giving you a Simple guide to play earnings announcement. If announced earnings are substantially above consensus estimates of revenue of $8.26B and EPS of $0.56 than Tesla can make a new rally towards 500 dollars and if Tesla reports below expected results than it will tank and may fall going forward. So a close look should be given to earnings numbers. Keep in mind these two figures and whenever actual earnings are announced compare estimates with actual them with these estimates to make your decision to sell, buy or hold.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Link to Join on Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nAs per the latest news Workhorse Stock is under attack from Short Seller “Fuzzy panda Research” \nHello everyone, I hope you are doing really great, and if not then I am sure you will be pretty happy after watching this video about Workhorse Group. Because I will be covering some very important points and news items that no workhorse investor is factoring in at the moment. I believe the USPS contract is a done deal for Workhorse no matter what happens in elections and afterward. Workhorse is winning at least 15 billion dollars worth of contract from the total 20 billion dollar contract. And if you are guessing the news item than I am sorry to disappoint you that No I am not talking about the battery company Romeo Technology hinting at USPS contract leak. I have other solid news items that everyone is ignoring at the moment. Just keep patience because I will cover all the news and important points in this video including its price performance and trading strategy for elections. Workhorse is an easy money stock but only for those who have a plan. Because those who invest without a proper investment plan end up getting stuck at higher levels instead of making money by booking profits at appropriate levels. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

I will try to answer all the questions that every Hyliion investor is looking for answers at the moment. Like why Hyliion stock did not rally upward after the merger? Second Why Hyliion stock fell on the merger news? Third Hyliion is down 32%, should you buy now or wait for a further dip? Or should you book profit or loss assuming the merger game is over in Hyliion? Fourth can Hyliion go to 55 again so I can sell at a higher level? I recommended my viewers to book profits at 50 plus, how I was able to predict this profit taking levels when everyone else was giving TP to the moon? What is the future of Hyliion can we hold it for the long term? I will also share one secret sauce that I use to identify companies with 2 to 3 times capital gain potential so do watch completely and don’t miss key details.

I request you all to watch the whole video very carefully because I will be building my investment case in front of you. Listen carefully, as you can see here tesla is down almost 18% after touching 52 weeks high of 502. After the 5 for 1 split tesla has been struggling to jump back to its all-time high. And depending on news items we might see a further dip in next week. But that’s the thing investors should not be worried about. Now listen carefully I have an important point to clear. Let me show you the bigger picture. In the last 10 years, tesla is up by almost 10000% and on 1 years basis tesla is up by 750% and on 6 months basis tesla is up by 356%",

As you people know 30th September is gone and there is no announcement from the United States postal service about awarding the 20 billion dollar contract. So the big question is what lies ahead for workhorse? Before diving into details let me first give you an outline of the whole video.\nIn this video, I will talk about the price movement and what trading strategy you should use. Like should you book profits, buy more, or continue to hold your shares? I will also share my strategy that How I plan to earn a 60% return from workhorse stock in the short term.\nSecondly, Workhorse and Lordstown motors are closely linked to the Trump administration so who is winning the elections and how elections will affect the share price of both companies. I think no one is talking about this election issue but we all know that workhorse and Lordstown will be affected heavily due to the election results. So I would recommend you to watch this part closely to better understand the future price performance.\nI will also tell you exactly When the USPS contract is coming?\nAnd at the end of this video, I will show you what bearish and bullish analysts have to say about workhorse stock.",

I believe both of the companies can triple in the short term and investors are missing easy money stocks. I believe investors won’t be able to find investment opportunities with this much return potential in the stock market at the moment with the added advantage of low-risk taking. Just spare 8 to 10 minutes of your time to watch my Investment thesis, I am confident I can prove my point. I said the same thing in many of my videos when workhorse was trading at 15 and Lordstown motors at 17",

I believe the re-rating of Tesla stock is due after Battery Day. I will also discuss technical charts and outline a simple yet effective trading strategy that investors should use to maximize their profits instead of getting stuck at higher levels.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "https://www.patreon.com/MISx\n\nWelcome guys in this video we will talk about workhorse stock ticker symbol WKHS. A lot of exciting and positive news items are coming out recently about Workhorse. I believe something big is cooking in workhorse stock and we may see some huge announcements in the coming days. \nIn this video, I will talk about how workhorse is planning to expand its production capacity. if you remember, the biggest concern of Workhorse Bears is the limited production capacity. A lot of analysts were complaining that even if Workhorse gets the USPS contract they simply don’t have the capacity to produce its electric vans in large numbers. And now not only workhorse is planning to expand capacity it is also working round the clock to streamline its production and meet required quality standards. We will be discussing this capacity expansion and production efficiency measure in detail.\nI will also discuss why wall-street analysts have started increasing their price targets for Workhorse. And when workhorse will become profitable? Also, I will discuss the USPS contract and explain to you my rationale that why I believe that the chances of workhorse winning the USPS contract is at least 75%.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys; in this video, I will present a very comprehensive analysis of tesla stock. I will try to answer all the questions related to Tesla stock. Like should you buy Tesla after the split at 442 dollars or wait for the dip, or should you continue to hold tesla stock after the split or book profit at a higher level? How high can Tesla go after the split? Is Tesla a fundamentally strong company? Should you invest in Tesla for the long term or just trade the hype till it lasts? And most importantly, I will discuss the other side of the story as well. I will discuss some strong reservations of Tesla bears that you should keep in mind while making your long term investment decisions.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

As per the closing price of 499.23 dollars, apple will open trading at 124.8 dollars. In this video, I will try to answer all questions related to Apple stock.

What is the new price target of Apple stock? Can apple stock continue to rise just like pre-split phase? Is Apple a fundamentally strong company? Can Apple continue to deliver strong financial performance or is it just a giant bubble ready to pop any time? Should you be worried about the recent sale of apple stock by CEO Tim Cook? And finally, I will also discuss the other side of the story that is why so many analysts are calling for caution on Apple at current price levels?

I believe tesla is still undervalued and can provide handsome gains in the future. I will also discuss everything you need to know related to stock split dates and how to calculate post-split price. And what target price you should keep in mind before and after the split. \nSpreadsheet link.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/61k7z47r32sq4bk/Tesla%20Stock%20Split%20Calculations.xlsx?dl=0\n\n\nIn my last video I recommended my viewers to buy tesla stock immediately after the announcement of 5 for 1 stock split. I clearly saw an opportunity to earn big time so I got really excited and wanted to share the opportunity with my viewers as well. And now I am really glad that I shared my views timely with my viewers. Tesla’s stock price has increased by 49% in just 10 days. I am not saying that these gains are due to my analysis or prediction. \nBut identifying and recognizing a catalyst in a timely manner is a huge thing. I have received hundreds of comments that the stock split doesn’t change anything. And I am just giving them one simple answer “stock price performance tends to differ with you”. \nI know and 100 % agree that the stock split doesn’t change any fundamental thing. But stock splits do indicate a lot of positive things about a company. \nA stock split is a sign of a company’s confidence in its near-term growth prospects, as no company needs to lower its share price if it’s expected to drop on its own. Tesla expects that its share price is increasing rapidly and will continue to increase in the near future so they decided to issue stock split to lower its price. Also, higher liquidity means a company can raise capital from the market pretty easily. Tesla can raise billions from the stock market by issuing just 1 or 2 percent shares to institutional investors.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss NIO stock in detail. I will review its last week’s performance and then comment on what investors should expect from NIO stock in the coming days. Investors are ignoring a lot of positive changes that took place last week. I believe the fundamental story of NIO has totally changed; now I am even more excited about NIO. NIO is getting de-risked with each passing week. First I will discuss the last week’s performance and events related to NIO stock and then at the end, I would mention the key points that investors should keep in mind to make their future investment decision regarding NIO stock and will also show you how you can easily trade NIO stock on a daily basis through technical analysis. \nNIO started last week with a lot of excitement about results but ended up disappointing investors through poor price performance. I know most of the investors are disappointed that NIO didn’t sustain its Tuesday high of 15.45 dollars despite stellar results and fell almost 20% after opening strong at 15.45 dollars. And on top of that investors were really frustrated because apparently there was no obvious reason for this sudden price fall. It felt like some unseen thing was pulling NIO stock down. There is a rumor that JP Morgan chase is selling its stake in NIO stock. Maybe it is true because institutional investors tend to take benefit of high liquidity availability on key catalyst days. But there is no confirmation yet. In my last video, I also recommended viewers to play earnings announcement by buying before at lower levels and selling high after the announcement. May be JP Morgan Chase took it seriously.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision. I just share my views.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss apple stock in great details. I am really excited to share my research and findings with you guys because I really believe in the growth potential of Apple. I believe Apple can double or even triple your money after the stock Split and I have solid reasons to support my investment thesis. I am not the only one talking about this. I told you in my last video that analysts will start to increase their price targets after the blowout results, and that’s exactly what is happening right now. Analysts are giving a price target of 178 till January 2021 meaning 60% upside potential in just 4 to 5 months post 4 for 1 stock split. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will present a detailed analysis of the recently announced business model of NIO and will show you the real inside story instead of just mentioning the main headlines. I will explain what this business model means for the current stock price of NIO and for the future of NIO as a competitor of Tesla in China. Actually I am considering revising my yearly target upwards from the current target of 50 dollars after seeing NIO's current business model.\nAlso, I will present a detailed technical analysis of NIO stock so you would be able to make better-informed decisions about your investments in NIO in the current scenario. \nMore importantly, I will outline an effective day trading strategy, that you would be able to use to earn a minimum of 4 to 500 dollars on a daily basis from NIO stock price movements with minimum risk-taking. Please keep in mind I present technical analysis at the end of my video so do watch till the end so you would not miss on the opportunity to earn money from NIO even when it is in the consolidation phase.\nNow the first and the most important point of the NIO’s business plan is that NIO is setting up a battery asset management company in August this year and second is the announcement of the battery renting scheme and EC6 launch. This battery asset management company and BAAS, battery as a service model news might sound simple news but if you give it a deep thought you would be surprised to know that this business model would allow NIO to beat major EV players in China. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss 1 penny stock that I believe can provide explosive capital gains with negligible to no risk-taking at all.\nThe top Penny stock on my list is Tellurian Inc. Ticker symbol TELL\n\nTo help everyone understand what I mean by explosive returns and negligible to no risk at all, I would like to give you an example of my last top penny stock performer “American Lithium Corporation” ticker symbol LIACF. 17 days ago I recommended my viewers to buy LIACF when it was trading near .66 cents because at that price level the risk to reward ratio was in the buyer's favor. The risk was little to none but the reward potential was 300%. By risk I mean chances of the stock price going down and by reward potential, I mean chances of price going up. And you would be surprised to know that its price has more than doubled in just 17 days and now it is consolidating and trading near 1.36 dollars. I still believe it can double again given the high growth potential. So guys do check out that video, the link will be at the end of this video. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome Guys In this video, I will discuss 2 upcoming solid news items that will definitely move stock price of NIO because so far no one is factoring in these price-sensitive news items. And as always you will see that I was right. But before going into details I want to highlight one thing, in my last video I gave my viewers a short term trading tip to make quick money from falling NIO stock price. \nBased on Technical analysis I recommended my viewers to buy NIO shares near 11 instead of buying at higher levels. Now you would be surprised to know that after touching 11 dollars its price has bounced back and now it is trading near 12.4 again. Remember I give these tips apart from my long term price target of 50 dollars. I would highly recommend you to watch the video in which I showed calculations of my target price of 50 dollars for NIO. Also like this video and subscribe to my channel if you are interested to find our trading opportunities like these on weekly basis.\n\nBefore telling you about the upcoming news items I want to address two immediate concerns of investors the first one is why the price is falling after touching 15.9 and second I want to answer the Goldman Sachs on the downgrade of NIO stock.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss NIO Stock in detail and will try my best to answer all concerns and questions about NIO stock that no one is answering at the moment; also I will share my target price and trading strategy that you should use to maximize your return.\nNio is involved in the development and sales of Smart Electric Vehicle just like Tesla but many investors think NIO’s vehicles are not better then Teslas Electric Vehicles. But Nio’s Electric Vehicles have huge sales potential. Tesla offers only marginally better features and technology as compared to Nios electric vehicle and when you compare all this with the price tag then it convinces you to consider NIO as an alternative. NIO’s electric vehicles are way cheaper than Tesla, in some variants, the difference is huge close to 30000 dollars. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

And based on the latest news and technical analysis and I will guide you whether to buy it at current price levels or not? And I will share my target price with you guys at the end of this video after analyzing everything in front of you and also I will outline an effective strategy based on technical indicators to take entry at the most appropriate price level.\nThe stock price increased by 13% in a single day on Monday extending the rally to 40 percent in just 5 trading days. \nBut still, the important question is whether it can continue to climb higher or it will take a breather? A lot of people can be tempted to book profit after a 40% price jump. What about you wouldn’t you like to book profit in a share that has jumped 40% in just 5 days? Yes, a lot of people will be tempted to book profit but let's see if you will change your answer if I change the scenario of my question a little bit.\nWould you like to sell your tesla stock given that it has increased more than 500 percent in the last 12 months? \nWell that’s a difficult question and same as you a lot of experienced stock brokers are also confused about its valuation. \nNow before discussing technical points and giving you my opinion I want to show you an interesting thing about two different points of views on the tesla price target.\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

            "description": "Welcome guys in this video I will discuss two penny stocks that I believe can double in short term and provide us a good opportunity to make handsome money from the stock market. First on the list is American Lithium Corporation Ticker Symbol LIACF.\nAmerican Lithium Corp is involved in the acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium resources. The company owns a strategic vast mineable area closed to the Tesla Giga factory in Nevada. Ownership of Lithium is considered strategic nowadays due to its usage in technologies of the future like fully Electric Vehicles. Lithium battery has a longer life and lower charging costs.\nNext on the list is Electra Meccanica Vehicles Corp Ticker Symbol SOLO\nSolo is involved in the designing and manufacturing of electric vehicles. Currently, the company is planning 2 major vehicle types. One single-seater Electric Vehicle named Solo. And the other two-seater named E roadster. The company is planning to accelerate its expansion plan into different EV friendly cities like Arizona and Oregon by opening direct to consumer retail locations. \nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

Workhorse is involved in sales and development of electric vehicles like Tesla motors but it has a better product to offer in its niche market which no other US company is cattering at the moment. Yes you heard it right no other US company is offering Fully Electric Last Mile delivery vehicles.\nAnd unlike other companies like Nikola, Tesla and Hyliion their product is already on the roads. You can imagine the potential of their niche product by reading this, they are the only local US company selected to develop a next generation delivery vehicle for United States Postal Service. This is a huge opportunity valued at more than 6 billion dollars. If workhorse manages to get this opportunity than only sky is the limit for their stock price. I believe they have huge potential to grow their business.",

First you need to be clear of one thing that Hyliion Nikola and Tesla motors are direct competitors in Electric Truck Business.Now if I say to you that Hyliions trucks are better than Nikola’s trucks than you can imagine what Hyliions stock price would be in the future. Hyliion will be merging with Tortoise Acquisition corp ticker symbol SHLL which will change to HYLN after merger. So by SHLL I mean Hyln Hyliion stock. I still believe it is undervalued at the moment and it can provide double-digit returns in the near future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Note that I am not a financial adviser and you should do your own due diligence before making any decision.

You will be surprised to know at one point in time its price increased by almost 85% and now it is falling again. Always keep this in mind that you need to buy stocks with a pre-defined plan and that plan should to book profits at reasonable levels. Ideally you should have booked profits at this level as all technical indicators were in overbought territory. Otherwise you will end up at the start line again. In coming days I will be making video about when to buy a stock and when to sell a stock based on technical indicators. \nAnd the other stock that I highlighted for quick gains was Iron Mountain ticker symbol IRM its price has increased by almost 35% in a matter of just 15 days also one thing to note that IRM announced a handsome quarterly dividend of .618 dollars per share. \n3rd stock that I highlighted for quick gains of 50 to 100k was Berkshire Hathaway, at one point in time its price increased by 40000 dollars but now it is falling. Always remember to book profits at reasonable levels.\nBy following my top 3 stock picks you could have earned more than 50% return on your investment in matter of just 15 days.

The Dunning Kruger Effect.\nIn Reality they continue to lose money.\nThe Dunning Kruger effect is often seen in different talent shows. For Example, American Idol or Britain’s Got Talent. The auditions show different people with varying performance levels. \nThose who get rejected, due to bad performances, often show emotions of disbelief or shock.\nThe bitter truth is that humans are not very good at evaluating themselves.

Why do we over estimate ourselves?\nIn this video I will explain to you how you can avoid this bias and stop being beaten in the stock market with the help of an illustration.",
