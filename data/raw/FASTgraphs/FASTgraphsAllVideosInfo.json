            "description": "FAST Graphs Friday Analyze Out Loud Video: When Facts Change, Change Your Mind-But Not Before.   Learn Fron Your Mistakes\nForecasting Matters\nI believe that it is possible to forecast future business results within a reasonable range of accuracy. In contrast, I believe that attempting to forecast future stock price movements is a mistake, and an exercise in folly and futility. In my experience and opinion, this is such an important concept that investors need to understand - but alas, very few do. The daily volatility of stock price movements is a strong seductress and, in my experience at least, most investors simply cannot avoid the temptation. As a result, fundamentals, and the valuation they represent, are typically ignored or simply overlooked while recent price movements are obsessed over. \n\nForecasting Is the Key\nI believe that estimating future earnings growth is a major key to successful long-term stock investing. If you are a true investor, then you are actually investing in the business. Consequently, the success of the business that you invest in is going to be the primary determinant of how much money you can expect to earn on that investment. Stated more directly when you invest in a stock you are buying its future earnings potential.\n\nTo my way of thinking, the only logical reason I would ever want to own any stock (business) is because I believe that the company is a profitable enterprise. But not just in the past, or the present, but most importantly in the future. After all, and as I previously stated, future profits will be the source of any long-term return expectations I might have. Moreover, the growth of those profits will be a primary contributor to the total annualized return I can expect the investment to produce on my behalf.\n\nTherefore, I believe as investors, we cannot escape the obligation to forecast future earnings, because our results depend on it. Furthermore, we should not guess, nor should we simply play hunches. Instead, we must attempt to calculate reasonable probabilities based on all the factual information that we can assemble. Then we should apply analytical methods based upon our earnings driven rationale that provide us reasons to believe that the relationships producing earnings growth will persist in the future. In other words, we must strive to forecast future earnings as accurately as we possibly can. On the other hand, we should simultaneously realize that perfection is not to be expected.\n\nAs an aside, there are many who criticize or even claim that we should eschew utilizing forward earnings forecasts when trying to determine fair value, or even when trying to decide what stock to own. I find these positions rather bizarre. I cannot think of any logical reason why anyone would invest in a business unless they had a reasonable expectation of that business’s ability to generate future profits. Since I am confident that both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of the company’s future earnings power, estimating future earnings must be the essential element of long-term success.”\n\nAs investors, we can learn a great deal from the past about the businesses we are contemplating investing in. However, as investors, we must also recognize that we can only truly invest in the future.\n\nConsequently, although understanding a company’s history can help us better understand the business, our success is predicated on our ability to recognize the business’s future potential. And most importantly, we can also learn from past valuation levels, but we must calculate the present and future value of the business based on its capacity to produce a future income stream on our behalf. At its core, fair valuation is a function of discounting future earnings, cash flows and revenues back to the present value.\n\n(Reviewing Carnival (CCL), Meredith (MDP), Owens & Minor (OMI), Alpha Pro Tech (APT), Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\n\nClick here for The Dividend Kings two-week free trial:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/author/the-dividend-kings/research",

This week I covered pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) and the much smaller company in transition Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).\nIn the biotechnology subindustry I covered AbbVie (ABBV), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN), Gilead (GILD), and Vertex (VRTX).\n\nEven in today’s very expensive stock market, there are many healthcare stocks that are on sale.  Consequently, healthcare represents a fertile field for value-oriented investors seeking good investments that simultaneously provide a margin of safety.  I believe that 6 of the 7 stocks I am covering this week fit that bill.  Moreover, although one stock, Vertex, looks expensive, its price has been reverting to the mean torts fair value.  As a result, patient investors might keep their eye on this stock as it gets closer and closer to attractive valuation.\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today! \nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

This week I covered pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) and the much smaller company in transition Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).\nIn the biotechnology subindustry I covered AbbVie (ABBV), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN), Gilead (GILD), and Vertex (VRTX).\n\nEven in today’s very expensive stock market, there are many healthcare stocks that are on sale.  Consequently, healthcare represents a fertile field for value-oriented investors seeking good investments that simultaneously provide a margin of safety.  I believe that 6 of the 7 stocks I am covering this week fit that bill.  Moreover, although one stock, Vertex, looks expensive, its price has been reverting to the mean torts fair value.  As a result, patient investors might keep their eye on this stock as it gets closer and closer to attractive valuation.\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today! \nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/"

            "description": "There are many detractors that believe that dividend growth stock investing is stodgy, old and boring.  With this video, I plan to dispel some of those myths and prejudices.  Not only can dividend growth stock investing be modern and exciting, it can also be quite profitable.  Part of this lies in the reality that just like it is a market of stocks and not a stock market, dividend growth stocks come in all sizes, flavors, and colors.  Some grow slowly, some grow fast, some offer very high yields, some offer lower yields to grow very fast and every combination in between.\n\nPersonally, I have found that applying a valuation-based dividend growth stock investing philosophy works very well over the long run.  However, I have also broken dividend growth investing into two categories.  With one category I construct portfolios whose objective is to primarily produce a high level of current income within reason, coupled with the opportunity to see both that income and the capital grow consistently over time.  This type of portfolio best serves the investor who has accumulated enough assets to retire and live comfortably off the income those assets can produce.\nThe other category of dividend growth stock investing favors capital appreciation over current income.  With this strategy the objective is to focus on growth over current yield.  The idea is to build a portfolio that can grow at a high enough rate to eventually produce enough income to live off at some future time.  The financial services industry often refers to this as investing for retirement or for the accumulation phase prior to retirement.\n\nIronically, there can be a significant amount of overlap regarding the stocks that comprise either of the two affirmation portfolios.  This is often the result of valuation coming into play.  Low valuation produces what I call natural leverage that can lead to strongly above-average future capital appreciation through moderate growth and multiple expansion.  In other words, the inevitable reversion to the mean can serve as a turbocharger to the portfolio in the circumstances.\nFinally, this particular video focuses on attractively valued stocks with very consistent historical growth rate achievements.  There are many additional consistent growers that are unfortunately overvalued in today’s market, therefore, they have been excluded.  Names like Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Nike and others to name a few are great consistent growers that are unfortunately overvalued.  The key is to invest in great consistent producers when their valuation is attractive and their prospects for future growth intact.  With this video I offer 10 that I believe fit that bill.\n\nIn the video I will be reviewing AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Amgen (AMGN), Anthem (ANTM), Canadian Tire (CTC.A), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Altria Group (MO), Metro (MRU), Oracle (ORCL), Open Text (OTEX), T. Rowe Price (TROW) and S&P 500 (^SPX)\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

                "title": "10 Dividend Growth Stocks to Beat The Market",
                "description": "There are many detractors that believe that dividend growth stock investing is stodgy, old and boring.  With this video, I plan to dispel some of those myths and prejudices.  Not only can dividend growth stock investing be modern and exciting, it can also be quite profitable.  Part of this lies in the reality that just like it is a market of stocks and not a stock market, dividend growth stocks come in all sizes, flavors, and colors.  Some grow slowly, some grow fast, some offer very high yields, some offer lower yields to grow very fast and every combination in between.\n\nPersonally, I have found that applying a valuation-based dividend growth stock investing philosophy works very well over the long run.  However, I have also broken dividend growth investing into two categories.  With one category I construct portfolios whose objective is to primarily produce a high level of current income within reason, coupled with the opportunity to see both that income and the capital grow consistently over time.  This type of portfolio best serves the investor who has accumulated enough assets to retire and live comfortably off the income those assets can produce.\nThe other category of dividend growth stock investing favors capital appreciation over current income.  With this strategy the objective is to focus on growth over current yield.  The idea is to build a portfolio that can grow at a high enough rate to eventually produce enough income to live off at some future time.  The financial services industry often refers to this as investing for retirement or for the accumulation phase prior to retirement.\n\nIronically, there can be a significant amount of overlap regarding the stocks that comprise either of the two affirmation portfolios.  This is often the result of valuation coming into play.  Low valuation produces what I call natural leverage that can lead to strongly above-average future capital appreciation through moderate growth and multiple expansion.  In other words, the inevitable reversion to the mean can serve as a turbocharger to the portfolio in the circumstances.\nFinally, this particular video focuses on attractively valued stocks with very consistent historical growth rate achievements.  There are many additional consistent growers that are unfortunately overvalued in today’s market, therefore, they have been excluded.  Names like Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Nike and others to name a few are great consistent growers that are unfortunately overvalued.  The key is to invest in great consistent producers when their valuation is attractive and their prospects for future growth intact.  With this video I offer 10 that I believe fit that bill.\n\nIn the video I will be reviewing AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Amgen (AMGN), Anthem (ANTM), Canadian Tire (CTC.A), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Altria Group (MO), Metro (MRU), Oracle (ORCL), Open Text (OTEX), T. Rowe Price (TROW) and S&P 500 (^SPX)\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/"

            "title": "Building A Portfolio:  How Many Stocks Should I Own",
            "description": "One of the most asked questions I receive from investors is: how many stocks should I own or hold in my portfolio?  Or, they might ask: how diversified should my portfolio be?  On the flip side, I have had investors tell me that they would not be comfortable owning less than 50 stocks.  I even had some say that they wanted at least 150 stocks in their portfolio.  Frankly, I do not believe there is a “correct” or right answer to those questions.  Similarly, I do not think people who are suggesting they need a lot of stocks in their portfolio are wrong either.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some practical and/or mathematical realities that investors can use as guides.  For example, what about weightings.  Should you overweight certain stocks and underweight others?  Recent academic studies suggest that once you get past 16 stocks you have used up most of the benefit of diversification.

                "title": "Building A Portfolio:  How Many Stocks Should I Own",
                "description": "One of the most asked questions I receive from investors is: how many stocks should I own or hold in my portfolio?  Or, they might ask: how diversified should my portfolio be?  On the flip side, I have had investors tell me that they would not be comfortable owning less than 50 stocks.  I even had some say that they wanted at least 150 stocks in their portfolio.  Frankly, I do not believe there is a “correct” or right answer to those questions.  Similarly, I do not think people who are suggesting they need a lot of stocks in their portfolio are wrong either.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some practical and/or mathematical realities that investors can use as guides.  For example, what about weightings.  Should you overweight certain stocks and underweight others?  Recent academic studies suggest that once you get past 16 stocks you have used up most of the benefit of diversification.  Other studies indicate that a portfolio of approximately 30 stocks is optimum.  Personally, I believe the right number is heavily predicated on the psychology and risk profile of the individual building the portfolio.  People who are very risk-averse would need more stocks versus people who had a higher tolerance for risk.\n\nNevertheless, there are many approaches that can be taken and/or implemented to build a portfolio that is just right for you.

What I am worried about is the extremely high relative valuation of the market in Today’s Expensive Market.  To be clear, the market can be trading at an all-time high and still be attractively valued.  Moreover, the long-term direction of the stock market has been up.  On the other hand, that ascension is interrupted from time to time due to overvaluation eventually instigating the inevitable reversion to the mean valuation.\n\nWith the above said I am on record many times of pointing out that it is a market of stocks not a stock market.  In summary, this simply means that in every market - whether it be a bull market or a bear market - there will always be value to be found.  Obviously, you can find more value in a bear market than you can in a bull market.

When you are looking at regular businesses, the company’s current valuation is a primary consideration.  This is typically measured utilizing metrics such as the P/E ratio, price to cash flows, price to sales and other valuation tools.  With growth stocks, the value lies in the future.  The incredible power of compounding applies.  What truly makes growth stocks different is how fast and how much they grow their earnings and cash flows.  With traditional or average companies, it takes 7 to 10 years or longer to double your money.  Therefore, measurements such as current earnings yield and/or current cash flow yield are paramount.\n\nGrowth stocks grow very fast, but that is very hard to do.  Therefore, investing in growth stocks is technically riskier.  However, when successful, the rewards far outweigh the risks.  It is only by investing in growth stocks where you can find the proverbial 10 baggers or more that Peter Lynch often talked about.  Consequently, it is both logical and necessary that when investing in growth stocks you focus on the future.

            "description": "Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs are a very popular asset class especially for people looking for above-average dividend income with a capital appreciation kicker.  Traditional REITs are known for investing in real estate such as apartments, hotels, healthcare facilities, office buildings, shopping malls, and even mortgages, etc.  However, to many investors those types of REITs are considered old-school.\n\nIn the 21st-century one of the hottest segments of REIT-dom are Data Center REITs.  These are real estate investment trusts that own server farms for the Internet and other data hungry needs.  Today, everybody, and most every business is online creating massive needs for data storage. \n\nThere are 5 major data center REITs, and they are CoreSite Realty Corp. (COR), Digital Realty Trust (DLR), Equinix (EQIX), CyrusOne CONE), and QTS Realty Trust (QTS).  Although these are the 5 major datacenter REITs, there is also a 6th choice Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM), which is more diversified but focusing more and more on data storage.  For year-end 2020 storage revenues were just under $700 million increasing slightly less than 3%.  This compares to their service revenues which amounted to about $360 million which fell approximately 11%.  Clearly, the data storage business is a major focal point of the company and the largest potential source of future growth for Iron Mountain.  This leads some investors to choose datacenter REITs as a substitute opportunity for mostly inflated tech stocks.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

Therefore, I consider it the first step, albeit an essential first step prior to a more comprehensive research and due diligence effort.  Furthermore, I often get requests from subscribers to cover certain stocks.  Unfortunately, I cannot cover all the stocks that are requested, but I do try to present the ones that I find most interesting. \n\r\nOn the other hand, most of my channel videos are based on examples that I either find interesting, compelling as investments or examples that can provide important learning experiences.  I am a fervent believer that knowledge is power and my primary objective with this channel is to empower investors with the knowledge to make sound and prudent long-term investing decisions.\r\nFinally, please understand that when I’m doing a subscriber request, you should automatically recognize that I might not have thoroughly researched the company or companies I am covering.  \n\nTherefore, I am simply presenting the “essential fundamentals at a glance” and how they relate to the company’s intrinsic value based solely on the numbers representing the fundamentals underpinning the business.  Once again, I consider this an essential first step before conducting a more comprehensive research and due diligence effort.  Nevertheless, before your money is laid down, the comprehensive research effort should be conducted.  My job is to simply make the research process easier, faster, and hopefully more fun and enjoyable.\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

Therefore, I consider it the first step, albeit an essential first step prior to a more comprehensive research and due diligence effort.  Furthermore, I often get requests from subscribers to cover certain stocks.  Unfortunately, I cannot cover all the stocks that are requested, but I do try to present the ones that I find most interesting. \n\r\nOn the other hand, most of my channel videos are based on examples that I either find interesting, compelling as investments or examples that can provide important learning experiences.  I am a fervent believer that knowledge is power and my primary objective with this channel is to empower investors with the knowledge to make sound and prudent long-term investing decisions.\r\nFinally, please understand that when I’m doing a subscriber request, you should automatically recognize that I might not have thoroughly researched the company or companies I am covering.  \n\nTherefore, I am simply presenting the “essential fundamentals at a glance” and how they relate to the company’s intrinsic value based solely on the numbers representing the fundamentals underpinning the business.  Once again, I consider this an essential first step before conducting a more comprehensive research and due diligence effort.  Nevertheless, before your money is laid down, the comprehensive research effort should be conducted.  My job is to simply make the research process easier, faster, and hopefully more fun and enjoyable.\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/"

            "description": "This is a subscriber request follow-up on a video I produced in October 2019 on Lithia Motors Inc. (LAD) Titled: “Hot Stock On Earnings Beat - Lithia Motors Inc $LAD.”  The stock was very inexpensive at that time trading at a blended P/E ratio of only 11.83 on a company with a long-term growth rate of 10.12%.  But more to the point, since coming out of the great recession of 2008, the stock’s growth rate has exploded.  In conjunction with that earnings increase, the stock price went from $130 a share on October 22, 2019 to $369 a share through yesterday’s close.  That translates into a total annualized rate of return of 112.5% per annum.  Growth has been 179% and when you add in dividends the total rate of return 180%. \n\nHowever, the stock was extremely inexpensive when I produced the initial video.  Therefore, the explosive earnings growth generated the explosive price growth.  But perhaps most importantly, based on future estimates it ain’t over yet baby.  The company is still expected to grow long-term at over 25% per annum, and based on the current blended P/E ratio of 20, it is still attractively valued.  Not necessarily dirt cheap like it was a year ago, but attractive, nevertheless.  If you are looking for high total return in this overheated market Lithia Motors might still fit the bill.

            "description": "FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video: Alpha Pro Tech Limited, A Growth Opportunity\nIn the following video I elaborate more on the opportunity that this COVID-19 pandemic growth stock play offers for those interested in total return.  Clearly it is not a dividend paying stock.

            "description": "AT&T reported earnings today and although they beat expectations, the stock is trading down over 2% so far.  The company was light on revenues compared to 2019 but did report free cash flow for the year of $27.5 billion, slightly below the $29 billion reported in 2019.  However, on a promising note to some, the company did put their cash flow to good use.  For starters, they reduced their debt maturities over the next 5 years by about 50% and lowered their weighted average interest rate on debt to only 4%.  On the conference call, CEO John Stankey articulated three priorities for the year.  First, they are looking to grow their direct customer relationships, second, to transform their operations to be more effective and efficient, and third, and most importantly, to use their free cash flow after dividends to pay down debt.  \n\r\nOn the negative side, the company did not increase their dividend as some had hoped, but did commit to maintaining it.  \n\r\nSince I have had several requests from channel subscribers to cover AT&T, I thought this would be the appropriate time.  Consequently, this video will focus on AT&T by the numbers with the primary focus on current valuation and future potential.  To me, the bottom line is a very attractive and well covered 7% current dividend yield that is very high considering today’s low interest rates despite not growing this year.  Additionally, since the great recession, AT&T has only grown their dividend at an average rate of 2.1% per annum.  Therefore, income-oriented investors are not really losing too much.  With all this said, low valuation not only mitigates much of the risk, but also positions buy-and-hold investors with significant capital appreciation potential mid-term.\n\nOriginal article can be found here:\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/att-had-its-earnings-call-today-should-we-answer/\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

            "description": "Introduction\nIn the comment section of my last video a subscriber asked me if I had any opinion on Dropbox (DBX), a young fast-growing tech stock.  Although this is a company that I have not researched for investment purposes, it is a company whose product I use in my own business and to a lesser extent in my personal life.  Therefore, even though I did not have an investment opinion, I am familiar.\nMorningstar provides the following business description:\n\n“Dropbox provides cloud-based file storage, sharing, and project collaboration services for individuals and, to a lesser extent, enterprise customers. The company was founded in 2007 and offers a browser service, toolbars, and apps to upload, share, and sync files to the cloud that can be accessible across a number of devices and by a multitude of users. Dropbox allows users to store and access documents, videos, and photos.”\n\nAlthough the company faces stiff competition from well-capitalized behemoths such as Microsoft and Google, the company has carved out a niche for itself.  Consequently, since its founding in 2007, the company has attracted 600 million users and generated approximately $1.7 billion in revenues.  However, as is often the case, the company’s historically high growth rate is showing signs of slowing down.  Nevertheless, the company is still expected to grow their free cash flow fast enough for me to consider it reasonably valued at current levels.  The real question is - can the company sustain above-average growth long-term?  I leave it up to the viewer to decide for themselves.  Based on what I show in the video, I believe the company is worthy of further consideration for investors looking for long-term capital appreciation and total return.\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

In today’s very high market, the tech sector dominates the high valuation.\n\nIn contrast, there are sectors that are significantly undervalued - and have been for some time.  The most glaring example is the financial sector.  Ever since the great recession of 2008 financial stocks in general have traded at discounts to their intrinsic value and their historical norms.

As I will illustrate later, their primary allure is consistent safe above-average dividend income and safety through both quality and valuation.\n\nIn this video I will cover 9 high-quality A- rated or better life and health insurers that offer intriguing margins of safety.

            "description": "Please accept this special edition offering on Walt Disney Company (DIS) as a lesson on valuation.  Over the many years I have been a value investor, I have learned that even the best companies can become dangerously overvalued by the market.  Sometimes they can remain that way for extended periods of time.  We have seen this many times in history.  The “Nifty Fifty” era, the irrational exuberant era, the tech bubble, etc.  All of those periods of time they were classifications of stocks that had tremendous momentum, but they all ended badly in the long run.  In the short run sentiment rules, but in the long run fundamentals are what matters the most.\n\nThe ARTICLE that goes along with this video can be found here:  \nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/walt-disney-company-a-lesson-on-overvaluation/\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\n\nClick here for The Dividend Kings two-week free trial:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/author/the-dividend-kings/research",

                "description": "Please accept this special edition offering on Walt Disney Company (DIS) as a lesson on valuation.  Over the many years I have been a value investor, I have learned that even the best companies can become dangerously overvalued by the market.  Sometimes they can remain that way for extended periods of time.  We have seen this many times in history.  The “Nifty Fifty” era, the irrational exuberant era, the tech bubble, etc.  All of those periods of time they were classifications of stocks that had tremendous momentum, but they all ended badly in the long run.  In the short run sentiment rules, but in the long run fundamentals are what matters the most.\n\nThe ARTICLE that goes along with this video can be found here:  \nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/walt-disney-company-a-lesson-on-overvaluation/\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\n\nClick here for The Dividend Kings two-week free trial:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/author/the-dividend-kings/research"

            "description": "The most utilized metric to value a stock is the P/E ratio.  In its simplest form, that is simply the price of the stock divided by the earnings-per-share. It is a valuable valuation metric, because in the long run a company’s stock price will correlate with its earnings. But the real question is what earnings metric is it based on?  Moreover, the P/E ratio can be confusing because it will often be reported differently on different financial websites.  The primary reason is because different websites produce P/E ratios utilizing different iterations of earnings. FAST Graphs provides subscribers all four of the primary earnings metrics that are utilized or reported.\n\nWith this FAST Graphs Value-You Academy installment, Bill Kay will break down and illustrate the differences and how they are generated on the 4 primary earnings metrics. Publicly traded companies report their financial results in different ways for various reasons.  Bill will illustrate the difference between the key reported earnings metrics: \n1.Adjusted (Operating) Earnings also known as reported earnings, Warren Buffett’s favorite \n2.Owners Earnings a close cousin to free cash flow\n3. Basic Earnings and finally \n4. Diluted Earnings (GAAP).  Additionally, Bill will explain why companies report these different earnings metrics and explain the adjustments found in the financial statements that are used to calculate them.\nTry FAST Graphs for Free:\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

                "description": "The most utilized metric to value a stock is the P/E ratio.  In its simplest form, that is simply the price of the stock divided by the earnings-per-share. It is a valuable valuation metric, because in the long run a company’s stock price will correlate with its earnings. But the real question is what earnings metric is it based on?  Moreover, the P/E ratio can be confusing because it will often be reported differently on different financial websites.  The primary reason is because different websites produce P/E ratios utilizing different iterations of earnings. FAST Graphs provides subscribers all four of the primary earnings metrics that are utilized or reported.\n\nWith this FAST Graphs Value-You Academy installment, Bill Kay will break down and illustrate the differences and how they are generated on the 4 primary earnings metrics. Publicly traded companies report their financial results in different ways for various reasons.  Bill will illustrate the difference between the key reported earnings metrics: \n1.Adjusted (Operating) Earnings also known as reported earnings, Warren Buffett’s favorite \n2.Owners Earnings a close cousin to free cash flow\n3. Basic Earnings and finally \n4. Diluted Earnings (GAAP).  Additionally, Bill will explain why companies report these different earnings metrics and explain the adjustments found in the financial statements that are used to calculate them.\nTry FAST Graphs for Free:\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/"

Instead, I’d like to point out that the risk we are facing right now is what I call an event risk.  This is something unforeseen that comes along every so often that has enormous economic impact, and in this case an impact on our health as well.  However, the good news (if there even is such a thing) in these situations is that they are normally short-lived.  Therefore, in the long-term scheme of things, event risks usually contain significant short-term risk but eventually enormous long-term opportunity.\n\nMoreover, I think it’s also important to recognize that a crisis like we are currently facing, although affecting virtually every industry, affects some significantly more than others.  In that vein, today I will be producing a video covering the major cruise lines.  In follow-up videos I will be looking at restaurants and casinos to additional industries that are facing significant economic impacts.  \n\nAirlines, and anything associated with travel, represents another sector that is under stress.

If the cruise line industry survives this crisis, then we are witnessing an unprecedented buying opportunity.  On the other hand, depending on the extent and duration of this crisis, these companies can also be facing potential bankruptcy.  Therefore, prudent investors should recognize that investments in the cruise industry today are speculations.  However, with great short-term risk can come great long-term returns.

Standard & Poor’s produces this premier list of blue-chip dividend growth stocks that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years.  Given the quality and blue-chip status of this group of dividend achievers, they are typically in high demand, especially given today’s low interest rate environment.  Consequently, most of them have been available at excessively high valuations which has greatly reduced their appeal and opportunity.\n\nHowever, thanks to the panic over the coronavirus with the added fears surrounding the energy sector, the market has corrected in recent days.  As a result, many of these premium blue-chip dividend growth stocks have come into value despite continuing strength in their fundamentals.  Nevertheless, even though the recent correction has been scary, many of the Dividend Aristocrats are still too expensive to be considered good value.\n\nOn the other hand, the correction has brought us the opportunity to invest in several Dividend Aristocrats at attractive valuations relative to their fundamentals.  With this FAST Graph video, I will be presenting my top 10 Dividend Aristocrat selections for your further research and due diligence.  My selection criteria are both simple and straightforward.  I have chosen only Dividend Aristocrats that have A rated or better credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and offer earnings yields above 6%.\n\nTherefore, given their low valuations and long histories of growing their dividends, I would anticipate each of these as being capable of providing double-digit long-term rates of return over the next several years.  This will be comprised of capital appreciation plus a growing dividend income stream.  My lowest yielding selection provides a current yield of 2.09% and my highest yielding selection provides a current yield of 5.54%.  The average yield from an equal investment in each of these 10 research candidates would equal 3.34%.  The average dividend growth rate over the past 10 years has been 9.77%.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!",

            "title": "Tesla: Do the Fundamental Support the Stock Price?",
            "description": "Introduction\n\nI have been asked to provide a FAST Graph analyze out loud video on Tesla (TLSA) from many subscribers to our YouTube channel.  This is a difficult company to analyze based on fundamentals.  In some sense, it is really a tale of two companies.  The first story refers to the company fundamentals from the company trading as a public entity to current time.  The second story refers to the potential fundamental growth of the company going forward.\n\nImportantly, I want to stress to subscribers the reality that since May 31, 2019 Tesla stock price has more than tripled.  To put that into perspective, the price has recently risen in a parabolic advance.  However, it’s also important to recognize that earnings and cash flows are also expected to increase dramatically going forward.\n\nThe bottom line to me is that Tesla is certainly a very expensive stock today.  On the other hand, there is very interesting future growth expectations that could make long-term shareholders a lot of money.  The problem could be short to intermediate term potential risk due to the high current valuation.  Consequently, I would consider Tesla a long-term speculative opportunity with the potential for significant short-term pain.  This could be a classic example of my allegory where I suggest that great investors and great mountain climbers share a common understanding.  Both realize that the only way to get to the highest peak is to be willing to traverse the occasional valleys in between.  Caveat emptor (buyer beware).\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/",

                "title": "Tesla: Do the Fundamental Support the Stock Price?",
                "description": "Introduction\n\nI have been asked to provide a FAST Graph analyze out loud video on Tesla (TLSA) from many subscribers to our YouTube channel.  This is a difficult company to analyze based on fundamentals.  In some sense, it is really a tale of two companies.  The first story refers to the company fundamentals from the company trading as a public entity to current time.  The second story refers to the potential fundamental growth of the company going forward.\n\nImportantly, I want to stress to subscribers the reality that since May 31, 2019 Tesla stock price has more than tripled.  To put that into perspective, the price has recently risen in a parabolic advance.  However, it’s also important to recognize that earnings and cash flows are also expected to increase dramatically going forward.\n\nThe bottom line to me is that Tesla is certainly a very expensive stock today.  On the other hand, there is very interesting future growth expectations that could make long-term shareholders a lot of money.  The problem could be short to intermediate term potential risk due to the high current valuation.  Consequently, I would consider Tesla a long-term speculative opportunity with the potential for significant short-term pain.  This could be a classic example of my allegory where I suggest that great investors and great mountain climbers share a common understanding.  Both realize that the only way to get to the highest peak is to be willing to traverse the occasional valleys in between.  Caveat emptor (buyer beware).\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/"

            "description": "Try FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\nFAST Graphs Analyze out Loud Video: Pfizer Appears Undervalued\nIntroduction\nPharmaceutical giant Pfizer (PFE) is a company in transition that will soon be smaller but hopefully more profitable.  Since many of their established drugs are coming off patent, the company is divesting its older drug platform under the Upjohn brand and selling it to Mylan a leading generic pharmaceutical company.  Pfizer believes that this will position them for more profitable growth going forward.\nConsequently, after selling their established drugs to Mylan, the company will no longer have to offset patent losses.  Therefore, their pipeline of new drugs is expected to deliver strong results beyond 2020 which is expected to be a transition year.  According to Morningstar Pfizer’s patents, economies of scale and powerful distribution network support a wide moat.\n\nConclusions\nPfizer is a well-established pharmaceutical giant with enormous resources that is currently in transition.  Management expects that the new Pfizer will be capable of generating strong profitable future growth.\nHowever, markets tend to dislike change which has resulted in a very favorable current valuation on Pfizer shares.  As a result, the company offers exceptional current dividend yield and the long-term opportunity for exceptional total returns going forward.  Nevertheless, I do believe that investors interested in Pfizer take the time and make the effort to conduct their own due diligence.

            "description": "Try FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\nOne of the most common questions we receive regarding FAST Graphs is: why are P/E ratios different on the historical graphs versus the forecasting calculators?  Although this is a fair question, it also illustrates that many of our users are not fully understanding how the tool is designed and/or how it works or should be interpreted.  Therefore, I offer the following analyze out loud video to illustrate how, why and when the valuation multiples will change on a FAST Graph.\n\nHowever, before I post the video, a few introductory remarks on what FAST Graphs are, how they work and how they are intended to be utilized are in order.  For starters, FAST Graphs are a tool, and like any tool, their value will be proportionate to the skill of the person utilizing the tool.  The acronym FAST stands for fundamentals analyzer software tool.  The acronym is telling us that this is a tool that can help you analyze the fundamentals of a stock.  Nevertheless, the word analyze (analyzer) is the key concept to adopt.\n\nIn this context, we market FAST Graphs as a “tool to think with.”  Therefore, it is important to understand that FAST Graphs are not designed to dictate fair value, instead, they are built to reveal it.  As a result, it’s up to the user to analyze what the tool reveals and use that information to make smarter and more prudent long-term investment decisions.  Nevertheless, it’s also important to recognize that judgment is required. \n\nWe believe that FAST Graphs can help investors of all levels make better decisions regarding when to buy, sell or hold a publicly traded common stock.  Moreover, we believe our tool does that perhaps better than any other tool.  And in this context, we further contend that FAST Graphs are an authentic research tool that are simultaneously powerful and comprehensive. \n\nBy authentic we are suggesting that FAST Graphs do not purport to be anything more than they are.  Making sound buy, sell or hold investing decisions on common stocks is difficult and impossible to do perfectly.  However, FAST Graphs do facilitate that task within reasonable margins of error.  Assessing the fair value of a stock can only be done within reason because of the dynamic nature of trying to assess the value of a business with incessant ongoing operations.  Investors need to recognize and accept that a business is constantly generating changing operating results.  Therefore, calculating metrics such as earnings, cash flows, sales, etc., simply means taking a snapshot at a moment in time that has already passed.\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel by hitting the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button",

                "description": "Try FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\nOne of the most common questions we receive regarding FAST Graphs is: why are P/E ratios different on the historical graphs versus the forecasting calculators?  Although this is a fair question, it also illustrates that many of our users are not fully understanding how the tool is designed and/or how it works or should be interpreted.  Therefore, I offer the following analyze out loud video to illustrate how, why and when the valuation multiples will change on a FAST Graph.\n\nHowever, before I post the video, a few introductory remarks on what FAST Graphs are, how they work and how they are intended to be utilized are in order.  For starters, FAST Graphs are a tool, and like any tool, their value will be proportionate to the skill of the person utilizing the tool.  The acronym FAST stands for fundamentals analyzer software tool.  The acronym is telling us that this is a tool that can help you analyze the fundamentals of a stock.  Nevertheless, the word analyze (analyzer) is the key concept to adopt.\n\nIn this context, we market FAST Graphs as a “tool to think with.”  Therefore, it is important to understand that FAST Graphs are not designed to dictate fair value, instead, they are built to reveal it.  As a result, it’s up to the user to analyze what the tool reveals and use that information to make smarter and more prudent long-term investment decisions.  Nevertheless, it’s also important to recognize that judgment is required. \n\nWe believe that FAST Graphs can help investors of all levels make better decisions regarding when to buy, sell or hold a publicly traded common stock.  Moreover, we believe our tool does that perhaps better than any other tool.  And in this context, we further contend that FAST Graphs are an authentic research tool that are simultaneously powerful and comprehensive. \n\nBy authentic we are suggesting that FAST Graphs do not purport to be anything more than they are.  Making sound buy, sell or hold investing decisions on common stocks is difficult and impossible to do perfectly.  However, FAST Graphs do facilitate that task within reasonable margins of error.  Assessing the fair value of a stock can only be done within reason because of the dynamic nature of trying to assess the value of a business with incessant ongoing operations.  Investors need to recognize and accept that a business is constantly generating changing operating results.  Therefore, calculating metrics such as earnings, cash flows, sales, etc., simply means taking a snapshot at a moment in time that has already passed.\n\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel by hitting the \"SUBSCRIBE\" button"

            "title": "CBS and Viacom Merger: High Risk Tempered by Extremely Low Valuation",
            "description": "FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video: CBS and Viacom by the Numbers\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel by clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\"\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\nFree Trial to The Dividend Kings:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1319&sasource=new_auth_profile_header_ad\n\n14 years ago the Redstone family spun out Viacom (VIA) from CBS Corp (CBS).  However, the companies have decided to once again merge into what they hope will become a dominant entertainment company.  Given that the entertainment market is extremely competitive and quite risky, future visibility is very muddy in my humble opinion.  On the other hand, the extreme low valuation of the common stocks of both entities presents intriguing possibilities.  Consequently, I present either or both stocks as interesting but risky speculations.\n\nFAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video: CBS and Viacom by the Numbers\nWhat you will see in the following video are two examples of companies whose stocks have been in a freefall over the last two to three years despite decent fundamentals.  Typically, this would be indicative of great opportunities based on irrationally low valuations.  However, the prospects of the entertainment industry are both competitive and tenuous.  On the other hand, as more and more people have started streaming TV online, opportunities for growth are large.  Of course, that’s if the combined companies can prosper as they face intense competition.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAs a long time value investor, I have learned to trust fundamentals over market price in most cases.  However, there can be exceptions to every rule.  In the case of these media companies, their weak stock prices in the context of decent fundamentals seem suspicious.  Somehow, I am wondering if Mr. Market knows something that is not being reflected in historical results or forecasts.  I guess time will tell.\n\nIn closing, from a pure fundamental perspective, it seems logical to assume that most of the risk is already priced into the stocks.  I say this, because if these companies were able to return to historically normal valuations, the amount of short-term to intermediate-term money to be made is very large.  Therefore, either or both companies might represent excellent short to intermediate-term speculations at today’s valuations.  From a longer-term perspective, the strength scale and scope of the combined companies could be formidable going forward.  Caveat emptor.",

                "description": "FAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video: CBS and Viacom by the Numbers\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel by clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\"\nTry FAST Graphs for FREE Today!\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com/landingpage/\nFree Trial to The Dividend Kings:\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1319&sasource=new_auth_profile_header_ad\n\n14 years ago the Redstone family spun out Viacom (VIA) from CBS Corp (CBS).  However, the companies have decided to once again merge into what they hope will become a dominant entertainment company.  Given that the entertainment market is extremely competitive and quite risky, future visibility is very muddy in my humble opinion.  On the other hand, the extreme low valuation of the common stocks of both entities presents intriguing possibilities.  Consequently, I present either or both stocks as interesting but risky speculations.\n\nFAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video: CBS and Viacom by the Numbers\nWhat you will see in the following video are two examples of companies whose stocks have been in a freefall over the last two to three years despite decent fundamentals.  Typically, this would be indicative of great opportunities based on irrationally low valuations.  However, the prospects of the entertainment industry are both competitive and tenuous.  On the other hand, as more and more people have started streaming TV online, opportunities for growth are large.  Of course, that’s if the combined companies can prosper as they face intense competition.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAs a long time value investor, I have learned to trust fundamentals over market price in most cases.  However, there can be exceptions to every rule.  In the case of these media companies, their weak stock prices in the context of decent fundamentals seem suspicious.  Somehow, I am wondering if Mr. Market knows something that is not being reflected in historical results or forecasts.  I guess time will tell.\n\nIn closing, from a pure fundamental perspective, it seems logical to assume that most of the risk is already priced into the stocks.  I say this, because if these companies were able to return to historically normal valuations, the amount of short-term to intermediate-term money to be made is very large.  Therefore, either or both companies might represent excellent short to intermediate-term speculations at today’s valuations.  From a longer-term perspective, the strength scale and scope of the combined companies could be formidable going forward.  Caveat emptor."

Importantly, the core FAST Graphs will continue to function just as they always have.  However, with this initial launch there are two critically important changes that we want you to be aware of. First and foremost, we are changing our fundamental data provider from S&P Global Market Intelligence to FactSet Research Systems Inc. We will be displaying the same fundamental metrics, only the source of our fundamental data will change.  However, we will also be adding additional metrics that were not previously available.\n\nThe second and most obvious change that will be immediately noticeable will be the way you will navigate through the various FAST Graphs.  We have eliminated scrolling and moved to a tabular system.  This has become possible thanks to an upgrade to a more modern and functional software system.  In addition to a better navigation experience, our new software will also facilitate the ability to provide additional enhancements and metrics to our FAST Graphs over time.  We are quite excited about our greater capacity to continue building you a better FAST Graphs research tool.\n\nThe following YouTube video will introduce you to our new and improved FAST Graphs and serve as an introductory tutorial on how to utilize and navigate through this new version.  Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year.\n\nTeam FAST Graphs",

(NWL) has been one of the most requested stocks that I’ve been asked to provide an analyze out loud video on.  When I first  looked at it, I had to wonder why people were so interested in this particular stock.  Then I realized that statistically it looks great.  The company’s blended P/E ratio is quite low at 8.5 which is approximately half of what I would consider attractive, so valuation appears enticing.  As a result, the dividend yield is 4.2% which is quite high in today’s interest rate environment.  Moreover, the company only has 39% debt to capital which is also reasonable.\n\nNevertheless, I do consider the company too cyclical for my taste.  On the other hand, the valuation is compelling.  But, as I illustrated in the video, recent operating results have also been weak along with the stock price.  Consequently, I would only consider the stock a turnaround opportunity rather than a blue-chip dividend growth stock.  I will explain my position in the video.\nSign up for your 14-day free trial to FAST Graphs:\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel so you don't miss any of our stock investing videos!",

(NWL) has been one of the most requested stocks that I’ve been asked to provide an analyze out loud video on.  When I first  looked at it, I had to wonder why people were so interested in this particular stock.  Then I realized that statistically it looks great.  The company’s blended P/E ratio is quite low at 8.5 which is approximately half of what I would consider attractive, so valuation appears enticing.  As a result, the dividend yield is 4.2% which is quite high in today’s interest rate environment.  Moreover, the company only has 39% debt to capital which is also reasonable.\n\nNevertheless, I do consider the company too cyclical for my taste.  On the other hand, the valuation is compelling.  But, as I illustrated in the video, recent operating results have also been weak along with the stock price.  Consequently, I would only consider the stock a turnaround opportunity rather than a blue-chip dividend growth stock.  I will explain my position in the video.\nSign up for your 14-day free trial to FAST Graphs:\nhttps://www.fastgraphs.com\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel so you don't miss any of our stock investing videos!"

Historically the company has grown at double-digit above-average rates.  However, since coming out of the Great Recession the company’s earnings growth rate has accelerated significantly.  Consequently, Sherwin-Williams has been trading at uncharacteristically higher valuations than normal since 2013.  On the other hand, this higher valuation has been justified because of its higher growth.

            "description": "Although getting valuation right before you buy a stock is critically important to the long-term oriented retired dividend growth investor, it is not a short-term market timing concept.  My point is that short-term market movements are typically volatile and unpredictable.  The reason is simple.  Over short periods of time, which I define as less than a business cycle (3- 5 years), emotion has a major effect on stock prices.\n\nWhen dealing with common stock investments, the primary emotions that interfere with reason are fear and greed.  However, there are also subtle nuances associated with these primary emotional responses.  For example, if a stock is running to the upside, investors might feel they are missing out and invest regardless of valuation.  Although this is related to greed, it is a milder form.  Conversely, if a stock is falling precipitously, panic often sets in motivating investors to sell regardless of fundamental strengths.  Panic is related to fear, but it is an extreme form.",

                "description": "Although getting valuation right before you buy a stock is critically important to the long-term oriented retired dividend growth investor, it is not a short-term market timing concept.  My point is that short-term market movements are typically volatile and unpredictable.  The reason is simple.  Over short periods of time, which I define as less than a business cycle (3- 5 years), emotion has a major effect on stock prices.\n\nWhen dealing with common stock investments, the primary emotions that interfere with reason are fear and greed.  However, there are also subtle nuances associated with these primary emotional responses.  For example, if a stock is running to the upside, investors might feel they are missing out and invest regardless of valuation.  Although this is related to greed, it is a milder form.  Conversely, if a stock is falling precipitously, panic often sets in motivating investors to sell regardless of fundamental strengths.  Panic is related to fear, but it is an extreme form."

            "description": "The historical F.A.S.T. Graphs™ research tool provides a clear historical perspective of the company's normal operating results and prices or valuations.  Their primary purpose is to illustrate the strong correlation and functional relationship between earnings and market price (in the long run).  These graphs capture volumes of fundamental data at a glance.  However, it's important to understand that they are only \"tools to think with\" and should only represent the starting point to more extensive fundamental research.  On the other hand, in an instant, these powerful tools can tell the user more about the success of the businesses behind the companies they are analyzing than any other research tool available.",
