This book is very in depth and talks about all the figures you will find on financial statements like the Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. It really gives you a good idea of what all these numbers mean and how to interpret them.\n\nWith that said, I think the book was okay but personally I would not recommend it for the money and in the video I also explain why. Regardless, I think Ben Graham is a great author and investor, and I respect him greatly. He is also the author of the Intelligent Investor, which is arguably the best book on investing ever written.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument. I will NEVER ask you to send me money to trade for you. Please report any suspicious emails or fake social media profiles claiming to be me. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

This book is very in depth and talks about all the figures you will find on financial statements like the Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. It really gives you a good idea of what all these numbers mean and how to interpret them.\n\nWith that said, I think the book was okay but personally I would not recommend it for the money and in the video I also explain why. Regardless, I think Ben Graham is a great author and investor, and I respect him greatly. He is also the author of the Intelligent Investor, which is arguably the best book on investing ever written.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument. I will NEVER ask you to send me money to trade for you. Please report any suspicious emails or fake social media profiles claiming to be me. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose. There are no guarantees or certainties in trading or investing.\n\nMy videos may contain affiliate links or sponsorship to products I believe will add value to your life and help you.

CCIV is a SPAC that is rumored to be doing a merger with Lucid motors. There are some key things here that make it seem like the CCIV + Lucid merger could happen, so let me explain the evidence and my thoughts.\n\nLucid motors is an EV (electric vehicle) company that has a former Tesla executive and vice president as the CEO. Lucid motors is very much so replicating Teslas business model and already has a factory built. They seem like a premium EV company, and investors are very excited about the rumors with CCIV, which is causing the stock to spike.\n\n#CCIV #Lucidmotors\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This is a small cap stock that I have been talking about on my channel for months. The ticker is HEO.V or HEOFF, and the company is H2O Innovation. They're a smaller company exposed to the water desalination industry, and water industry in general.\n\nAs water scarcity continues, I believe H2O will benefit greatly and see growth, which is why I initially invested in the company months ago. Now they have a potential deal with Tesla, which sent the stock soaring 16% today, and maybe more soon.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This is a high growth stock in the drone delivery, and aerial autonomous vehicle industries. It really seems like a great company, and a global leader in drone delivery.\n\nThe company is EHang Holdings, ticker EH. It's a very high growth company that is projected to see revenue increase by more than 600% over the next 2 years. The drone industry alone is projected to take off over the next 3 years, and EHang just partnered with e-commerce giant JD.com to help them with express deliveries.\n\nEHang is also trying to expand into Europe and North America right now, as autonomous vehicles are seemingly the future. \n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This is a high growth stock in the drone delivery, and aerial autonomous vehicle industries. It really seems like a great company, and a global leader in drone delivery.\n\nThe company is EHang Holdings, ticker EH. It's a very high growth company that is projected to see revenue increase by more than 600% over the next 2 years. The drone industry alone is projected to take off over the next 3 years, and EHang just partnered with e-commerce giant JD.com to help them with express deliveries.\n\nEHang is also trying to expand into Europe and North America right now, as autonomous vehicles are seemingly the future. \n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This is why Gold is rallying above $1,900 and gold miners like Kirkland, Kinross and Barrick have all seen great days today.\n\nLastly, Democrats controlling the senate would make it easier for them to pass laws/bills around renewable energy, which would accelerate the growth of clean energy industries.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

The stock I sold is Aphria. After looking deeper into the merger with Tilray, I have decided to let the stock go.\n\nI have also purchased IIPR, which is an REIT with high growth potential, and BABA, or AliBaba. I think Alibaba is providing us with a great opportunity to get in the stock while it's on a massive dip. I have bought this dip and added to my position. Alibaba is a great long term growth stock in the Chinese economy, and I think it will do great in the future despite all the current fear.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

The stock I sold is Aphria. After looking deeper into the merger with Tilray, I have decided to let the stock go.\n\nI have also purchased IIPR, which is an REIT with high growth potential, and BABA, or AliBaba. I think Alibaba is providing us with a great opportunity to get in the stock while it's on a massive dip. I have bought this dip and added to my position. Alibaba is a great long term growth stock in the Chinese economy, and I think it will do great in the future despite all the current fear.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

These stocks are Trulieve, Kirkland Lake Gold, and H2O innovation.\n\nH20 Innovation has been running because of the recent California Water Futures being able to be purchased. Water scarcity is getting worse, and people are now able to hedge against water prices via these contracts. Water stocks have been rallying due to it.\n\nTrulieve is just doing amazing. Their most recent earnings were awesome, and I really see this stock as a long term hold.\n\nKirkland has seen a lot of selling recently, but the business is doing great and it seems like it's finally found some support to bounce back from. Only time will tell though!\n\nMy Research Platform - Stock Rover:\nhttps://www.stockrover.com/why-stock-rover/?sa_author=danielpronk\n\nMy Stock Trading Broker - Sign Up and Receive $50 In FREE Trades:\nhttp://www.questrade.com?refid=5d35f0e6ca378\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

These stocks are Trulieve, Kirkland Lake Gold, and H2O innovation.\n\nH20 Innovation has been running because of the recent California Water Futures being able to be purchased. Water scarcity is getting worse, and people are now able to hedge against water prices via these contracts. Water stocks have been rallying due to it.\n\nTrulieve is just doing amazing. Their most recent earnings were awesome, and I really see this stock as a long term hold.\n\nKirkland has seen a lot of selling recently, but the business is doing great and it seems like it's finally found some support to bounce back from. Only time will tell though!\n\nMy Research Platform - Stock Rover:\nhttps://www.stockrover.com/why-stock-rover/?sa_author=danielpronk\n\nMy Stock Trading Broker - Sign Up and Receive $50 In FREE Trades:\nhttp://www.questrade.com?refid=5d35f0e6ca378\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

CIIG is bringing Arrival to the public stock market through an IPO in early 2021. However, SPACs in general have been very hot in the stock market lately and some investors are saying we are currently in a stock market bubble, especially in the EV and SPAC space.\n\nBoth EVs and SPACs have experienced sell offs lately, and that leaves us as investors with the question, is it the time to buy? In this video I explain if I think we should be buying Arrival right now, and please remember that this is JUST MY OPINION.

CIIG is bringing Arrival to the public stock market through an IPO in early 2021. However, SPACs in general have been very hot in the stock market lately and some investors are saying we are currently in a stock market bubble, especially in the EV and SPAC space.\n\nBoth EVs and SPACs have experienced sell offs lately, and that leaves us as investors with the question, is it the time to buy? In this video I explain if I think we should be buying Arrival right now, and please remember that this is JUST MY OPINION.

As you all know, I purchased SBE (switchback) for their exposure to ChargePoint. This is now my main EV investment.\n\nI also shorted (short sold) Aurora (ACB) and sold Virgin Galactic (SPCE).

The stock I made this gain on is Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEPC, BEPC.TO, BEP).\n\nIn this video I also talk about the psychology of failure and how you can move past it. Failure is only failure when you decide it's not a lesson.

These 2 buy now stocks are Trulieve and Kirkland lake gold.\n\nI believe both of these companies have great futures ahead of them, especially considering the current state of our economy. Kirkland is a great hedge against inflation, and the FEDs money printer, printing trillions of dollars.\n\nTrulieve is a great high growth stock that I believe is undervalued right now, and giving investors a great opportunity.\n\nMy FULL Investment Course is available now on my website:\nhttps://www.danielpronk.com\n\nFurther Support The Channel Via Patreon!\nhttps://www.Patreon.com/DanielPronk\n\nMy Research Platform - Stock Rover:\nhttps://www.stockrover.com/why-stock-rover/?sa_author=danielpronk\n\nMy Stock Trading Broker - Sign Up and Recieve $50 In FREE Trades:\nhttp://www.questrade.com?refid=5d35f0e6ca378\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

(Email Sign up is at the bottom of the page)\n\nHello everyone, I'm Daniel Pronk and in this video I discuss my top 2 stocks to buy no matter who wins the election. These 2 buy now stocks are Trulieve and Kirkland lake gold.\n\nI believe both of these companies have great futures ahead of them, especially considering the current state of our economy. Kirkland is a great hedge against inflation, and the FEDs money printer, printing trillions of dollars.\n\nTrulieve is a great high growth stock that I believe is undervalued right now, and giving investors a great opportunity.\n\nMy FULL Investment Course is available now on my website:\nhttps://www.danielpronk.com\n\nFurther Support The Channel Via Patreon!\nhttps://www.Patreon.com/DanielPronk\n\nMy Research Platform - Stock Rover:\nhttps://www.stockrover.com/why-stock-rover/?sa_author=danielpronk\n\nMy Stock Trading Broker - Sign Up and Recieve $50 In FREE Trades:\nhttp://www.questrade.com?refid=5d35f0e6ca378\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

They're expecting $60.8 million in revenue, but I think that number is a little low, and I explain my thoughts.\n\nWe also discuss the edible undersupply in Canada right now, and how that will be a great revenue stream for Aurora in 2020. The analysts are also expecting an average of about $500 million in earnings for Aurora in 2020, so it could be a great year!\n\nThis is not investment advice.

                "description": "Hedge Funds Are *BUYING* Aurora + Earnings Estimates\n\nFollow me on Instagram @dpronk_\n\nIn this video I talk about analysts' recent earnings estimates for Aurora. They're expecting $60.8 million in revenue, but I think that number is a little low, and I explain my thoughts.\n\nWe also discuss the edible undersupply in Canada right now, and how that will be a great revenue stream for Aurora in 2020. The analysts are also expecting an average of about $500 million in earnings for Aurora in 2020, so it could be a great year!\n\nThis is not investment advice.
