Many investors in the stock market like to pay attention to what the \"smart money\" (billionaires) are doing with their portfolios, and keep track of what they are buying and selling.\n\nIn todays video, I discuss what Bill Gates is buying and selling in his own portfolio, and to my surprise, he has actually been selling quite a few very well known stocks.

(Stock Market Outlook)\n\nHello everyone, in todays video I discuss the potential impact of margin calls on the stock market and stocks in general in 2021. Margin calls are in the news today after Archegos Capital lost over $20 billion on margin today. Credit Suisse (CS) lost over 12% on the day when I was recording this video due to billions of dollars in losses to cover the margin call.\n\nMargin calls are what helped fuel the financial crisis, and stock crash of 2008. Margin debt is currently sitting at an all time high in 2021, and if the stock market downtrends or sees some sort of crash in the near future, then all of this margin debt could fuel the downside and add pressure to it.\n\nHear my thoughts on the stock market outlook in 2021 and in the future years.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This book is very in depth and talks about all the figures you will find on financial statements like the Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. It really gives you a good idea of what all these numbers mean and how to interpret them.\n\nWith that said, I think the book was okay but personally I would not recommend it for the money and in the video I also explain why. Regardless, I think Ben Graham is a great author and investor, and I respect him greatly. He is also the author of the Intelligent Investor, which is arguably the best book on investing ever written.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

In this video I discuss the short seller report, point out some key points, and rebuttal their claims that I think are silly.\n\nThe goal of this video is to give you the information you need to be more aware as to what situation with EHang and if it is a buy or a sell at these prices. The stock dropped over 62% today which was insane, but honestly I think it was an over reaction.\n\nEhang is an AAV business and has autonomous aerial vehicles that are electric. They are have agreements with cities, countries and governments all around the world. I don't think this business is done yet, and I think the growth will continue in the future.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

Verano I believe is undervalued relative to its peers and I think it's presenting investors with a great opportunity. I personally am going to be buying Verano, and here is my analysis of the stock.\n\nVerano in my opinion is much like Trulieve, and in some ways may even be a better growth stock. The growth the company is seeing has been incredible, however, Verano is only going to be listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange to start, then later move to the OTC.\n\nThere is still a way for US investors to gain exposure to Verano through buying SOLCF, Sol Global Investments. They hold 25.2 million shares of Verano, and could be a great option as well.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

Their AAVs have been chosen to be showcased in the 2024 Paris Olympics. It's crazy to see how much growth this company is seeing right now.\n\nTrulieve has expanded outside of Florida and is opening 7 more dispensaries in 2 more states. The company is also expanding massively in Florida and continues dominating there.\n\nH2O innovation acquired a new business for a great price and will immediately benefit from this acquisition. The stock is looking great and ready to continue trending up.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

CCIV is a SPAC that is rumored to be doing a merger with Lucid motors. There are some key things here that make it seem like the CCIV + Lucid merger could happen, so let me explain the evidence and my thoughts.\n\nLucid motors is an EV (electric vehicle) company that has a former Tesla executive and vice president as the CEO. Lucid motors is very much so replicating Teslas business model and already has a factory built. They seem like a premium EV company, and investors are very excited about the rumors with CCIV, which is causing the stock to spike.\n\n#CCIV #Lucidmotors\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This is a small cap stock that I have been talking about on my channel for months. The ticker is HEO.V or HEOFF, and the company is H2O Innovation. They're a smaller company exposed to the water desalination industry, and water industry in general.\n\nAs water scarcity continues, I believe H2O will benefit greatly and see growth, which is why I initially invested in the company months ago. Now they have a potential deal with Tesla, which sent the stock soaring 16% today, and maybe more soon.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

This is a high growth stock in the drone delivery, and aerial autonomous vehicle industries. It really seems like a great company, and a global leader in drone delivery.\n\nThe company is EHang Holdings, ticker EH. It's a very high growth company that is projected to see revenue increase by more than 600% over the next 2 years. The drone industry alone is projected to take off over the next 3 years, and EHang just partnered with e-commerce giant JD.com to help them with express deliveries.\n\nEHang is also trying to expand into Europe and North America right now, as autonomous vehicles are seemingly the future. \n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

Democrats winning the senate could have huge implications on businesses in 2021. They plan on raising corporate tax, which is why stocks like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. were all down today.\n\nThey also plan on introducing more government spending, which could lead to more money printing from the FED and potential inflation. This is why Gold is rallying above $1,900 and gold miners like Kirkland, Kinross and Barrick have all seen great days today.\n\nLastly, Democrats controlling the senate would make it easier for them to pass laws/bills around renewable energy, which would accelerate the growth of clean energy industries.\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

The stock I sold is Aphria. After looking deeper into the merger with Tilray, I have decided to let the stock go.\n\nI have also purchased IIPR, which is an REIT with high growth potential, and BABA, or AliBaba. I think Alibaba is providing us with a great opportunity to get in the stock while it's on a massive dip. I have bought this dip and added to my position.

These stocks are Trulieve, Kirkland Lake Gold, and H2O innovation.\n\nH20 Innovation has been running because of the recent California Water Futures being able to be purchased. Water scarcity is getting worse, and people are now able to hedge against water prices via these contracts. Water stocks have been rallying due to it.\n\nTrulieve is just doing amazing. Their most recent earnings were awesome, and I really see this stock as a long term hold.\n\nKirkland has seen a lot of selling recently, but the business is doing great and it seems like it's finally found some support to bounce back from.

AirBnB is becoming a publicly traded company, which means retail investors such as myself will be able to invest in the company (AirBnB).\n\nAirBnB has been in the news a lot lately because they're business isn't doing the best given the global situation, and I personally think that is one reason why they're looking to raise money through an IPO.\n\nAirBnB has also been growing faster that Booking, TripAdvisor, and Expedia. They really are seeing tremendous growth, which could provide investors with a good investment opportunity.\n\nMy FULL Investment Course is available now on my website:\nhttps://www.danielpronk.com\n\nMy Research Platform - Stock Rover:\nhttps://www.stockrover.com/why-stock-rover/?sa_author=danielpronk\n\nMy Stock Trading Broker - Sign Up and Recieve $50 In FREE Trades:\nhttp://www.questrade.com?refid=5d35f0e6ca378\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

CIIG is bringing Arrival to the public stock market through an IPO in early 2021. However, SPACs in general have been very hot in the stock market lately and some investors are saying we are currently in a stock market bubble, especially in the EV and SPAC space.\n\nBoth EVs and SPACs have experienced sell offs lately, and that leaves us as investors with the question, is it the time to buy?

I think SBE is presenting a good speculative opportunity to invest in Chargepoint ahead of their IPO later in 2020.\n\nThe entire EV sector is going crazy, and I wanted to be exposed to it. I think Chargepoint is a great option because they don't rely on one company like Tesla or NIO winning the EV (electric Vehicle) space. As long as EVs win, Chargepoint wins.\n\nMy FULL Investment Course is available now on my website:\nhttps://www.danielpronk.com\n\nFurther Support The Channel Via Patreon!\nhttps://www.Patreon.com/DanielPronk\n\nMy Research Platform - Stock Rover:\nhttps://www.stockrover.com/why-stock-rover/?sa_author=danielpronk\n\nMy Stock Trading Broker - Sign Up and Recieve $50 In FREE Trades:\nhttp://www.questrade.com?refid=5d35f0e6ca378\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument.

They're expecting $60.8 million in revenue, but I think that number is a little low, and I explain my thoughts.\n\nWe also discuss the edible undersupply in Canada right now, and how that will be a great revenue stream for Aurora in 2020. The analysts are also expecting an average of about $500 million in earnings for Aurora in 2020, so it could be a great year!\n\nThis is not investment advice.

This deal is the biggest deal in the MJ industry to this date. Is it a good or bad deal? Let me explain my thoughts.\n\nCanopy Growth is allowing Acreage to have full access to it's licensing, brands, and intellectual property. Acreage is leveraging these rights to build Canopys brand awareness in the US and solidify Canopy's foothold until the US legalizes MJ on a federal level.\n\nThis is a genius deal for both parties involved.\n\n#Canopy #Acreage #CanopyAcreageDeal\n\nThis is not investment advice.

            "description": "Why Warren Buffet Has $128 Billion In Cash + Stock Market Prediction\n\nIn this video, I explain why Warren Buffet is holding $128 Billion in cash. I personally believe it is due to the upcoming correction/recession in the stock market. Warren Buffet himself says he is not buying because he does not see any great investment opportunities right now.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the stock market is indeed overvalued since Warren Buffet cannot find any value in it. He goes on to show that he is not even buying Berkshire Hathaway's stock at its current levels because it is too overpriced.\n\nThis is not investment advice.
